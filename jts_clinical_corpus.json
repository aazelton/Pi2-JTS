    "text": "         Advanced Life Support5 Initiate ALS as soon as feasible, with ECG monitoring to guide management. Figure 312 and Table 10 direct specific actions based on the arrest rhythm present. In contrast to people, the most common arrest rhythm in MWDs is pulseless electrical activity (PEA; 24%), followed by asystole (23%), and then ventricular fibrillation (VF; 20%). Sinus bradycardia commonly precedes arrest in many situations in dogs.2,5 • 70% of MWDs that arrest will have PEA, asystole, or sinus bradycardia as the initial arrest rhythm.2,5 Epinephrine or vasopressin are best choices for these rhythms or for empiric use if ECG capability is not available. In the deployed setting, there is no role for transthoracic pacing in MWDs with PEA or asystole. • Bradycardia due to a pronounced vagal response is very common in dogs, and use of atropine may prevent development of cardiopulmonary arrest. • VF, while present initially in only 20% of MWDs with an arrest rhythm, often develops during resuscita­ tion.2 Perform external defibrillation if possible and as rapidly as possible if VF is noted; biphasic defibrilla­ tion is ideal.5,7 Apply paddles to either side of the chest with the MWD in dorsal recumbency (on its back), or place a flat paddle under the MWD lying in lateral recumbency and a standard paddle on the upper chest wall. Defibrillate up to 3 times at each energy level if prior attempts are not successful, but perform aggressive chest compressions for at least 2 minutes before attempting each defibrillation. • IV access is critical. Place multiple IV or IO catheters or perform venous cut-down (See Chapter 6, Figure 33). Follow all drugs with a 10 mL saline push. Do not give large volumes of fluids to MWDs during CPR, unless severe hypovolemia is thought present. Give fluids initially to facilitate drug delivery only. Tips for Successful CPR in MWDS2,3 • Avoid interrupting chest compressions! The key to successful resuscitation is to SUSTAIN chest compres­ sions aggressively for 2-3 minutes before stopping to check status. • Most people apply too little force when performing chest compressions! Do not be concerned with break­ ing ribs or injuring the heart or chest with BLS. In contrast to CPR in people, the thorax of MWDs is more compliant and fractures are rare. • Maintain a steady and continuous rate of chest compression and ventilation. Minimize the number of times you stop to check the patient. Most people stop too frequently, which makes BLS less successful. • During CPR, consider sodium bicarbonate (1-2 mEq/kg IV, repeated every 10 minutes) if metabolic acidosis (pH <7.0) is present, or empirically if CPR is prolonged >10 minutes. • During CPR, consider magnesium sulfate (30 mg/kg IV, once) in patients with refractory VT. Single Person CPR Single-person CPR on dogs is extremely challenging, with very poor success rates, and should be initiated only if other personnel are immediately nearby and can be mobilized to assist in 1-2 minutes. If single-person CPR is performed, the responder should only perform chest compressions, as this optimizes circulation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation 31",

    "text": "            Standard Shock Therapy (continued) 4. Human serum albumin (HSA) use. Do not give HSA or other synthetic colloids (e.g., dextrans) to MWDs, be­ cause severe allergic reactions are possible (HSA) and coagulopathies are common (dextrans). Some data suggest benefit in a very limited subset of patients with severe hypoalbuminemia,22,23 but risks far out­ weigh potential benefit in dogs with shock. 5. Blood product use. Canine blood products are not available for immediate HCP use.2 Dogs cannot be trans­ fused with human blood products. HCPs will have to manage hemorrhagic shock with crystalloid and col­ loid therapy. 6. Tranexamic acid (TXA) and ɛ-aminocaproic acid (EACA) use. There is limited, but promising, data to guide use of TXA24-27 and EACA28 in dogs with hemorrhage. Dogs appear to be hyperfibrinolytic compared to hu­ mans, suggesting higher doses of TXA may be needed in dogs. Consider TXA or EACA if the dog is anticipat­ ed to need significant blood transfusion, such as severe hemorrhagic shock, limb amputation, penetrating torso trauma with severe non-compressible bleeding, because canine blood products are not available. Ad­ minister these drugs as soon as possible after trauma, but NO LATER THAN 3 HOURS post injury. • TXA: 10 mg/kg in 100 mL NS or LRS, IV over 15 min. • EACA: 150 mg/kg in 100 mL NS or LRS, IV over 15 min. • If bleeding continues, a CRI of additional TXA at 10 mg/kg/hour for 3 hours can be administered. 7. Targeted shock resuscitation end points that are practical for HCPs include systolic and mean arterial pres­ sures, level of consciousness and mentation, mucous membrane color and capillary refill time, HR, RR, and pulse quality. • Target a MAP >65 mmHg or a Sys >90 mmHg. Note that neonatal or pediatric blood pressure cuffs must be used (See Chapter 2). • Target normal level of consciousness (LOC) and an alert mentation. • Target light pink-to-salmon pink MM and a CRT <2 seconds. • Target a HR that is 60-90 beats per minute at rest with a strong, synchronous pulse quality. • Target a respiratory rate at rest of 12-40 breaths per minute with normal effort. • Once shock has abated, continue IV crystalloid fluids at 3-5 mL/kg/hour for 12-24 hours to maintain ade­ quate intravascular volume. 8. Provide supplemental oxygen therapy. Oxygen supplementation is critical. Every shock patient should re­ ceive supplemental oxygen therapy until stable (See Chapter 3). 9. Identify and treat the cause of shock. The cause of shock must be corrected, if possible. • Patients with massive intra-abdominal or intrathoracic bleeding need surgery to find the site of bleeding and surgically correct the loss of blood, with the caveats in mind as discussed previously. • Chapter 4 addresses emergent resuscitative thoracotomy. Chapter 7 addresses emergent abdominal laparotomy. • Euthanasia should be considered to prevent undue suffering for a MWD for which emergent surgery is deemed necessary but cannot be performed or has proven unsuccessful (See Chapter 21).

Epinephrine or vasopressin are best choices for these rhythms or for empiric use if ECG capability is not available • Avoid interrupting chest compressions! The key to successful resuscitation is to SUSTAIN chest compressions aggressively for 2-3 minutes before stopping to check status. • Most people apply too little force when performing chest compressions! Do not be concerned with breaking ribs or injuring the heart or chest with BLS. In contrast to CPR in people, the thorax of MWDs is more compliant and fractures are rare",

OR • High Pressure Alarm: 50% above the baseline PIP (1.5 x current PIP) • Low Pressure Alarm: 50% below the baseline PIP (0.5 x current PIP) **Pressures will be determined by placing patient on ventilator for ~ 1-2 minutes and determining intrinsic peak inspiratory pressure. (Labeled as PEAK on 754 Ventilator (top right); Labeled as Ppeak on Hamilton T1 (top left)** Monitor waveform on machine and patient to ensure no breath stacking occurs. If this occurs, a high-pressure alarm may sound. However, if breath stacking suspected even in absence of alarm – disconnect tubing and allow exhalation. Increase I:E. Troubleshooting: Airway Compromise or Lost Airway In-Flight • If at any time patient begins to desaturate or develop respiratory problems, immediately disconnect ventilator, and ventilate patient with BVM (with PEEP valve if available) and 100% O2 while correcting issues utilizing the D.O.P.E. algorithm: • Displacement: ETT in place, patient not extubated/ tube did not move during transfer. If advanced – pull back to original length and attempt to bag; if tube has pulled farther out of trachea, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ADVANCE IT without placement of bougie to verify tracheal placement. When advancing bougie, feel for tracheal rings or carina stop. If in doubt, pull tube and attempt BVM. If this fixes problem, continue to bag patient. Upon stabilization, consider alternative advanced airways (extraglotic airway or cric) **If ETT moves freely, assess for ETT bulb rupture. ** • Obstructions: Assess for secretions in ETT. Suction if indicated • Pressure: Ensure that a tension pneumothorax / hemothorax has not developed (if chest tube in place, ensure it is functioning/ not kinked or clamped). If tension pneumothorax / hemothorax suspected, perform immediate needle thoracostomy. Assess the need for escharotomy if circumferential burn. Consider additional paralysis and sedation if patient does not tolerate ventilation • Equipment: Ensure that vent did not fail; O2 tank not empty. If ventilator is operational, trace all tubes to the patient connection (airway tube, transducer line, exhalation line) ensuring patency and connections • High Pressure Alarms / Peak Airway Pressure Alarms (Peak pressure >35 cm H2O): Correct problems causing increased airway resistance and decreased lung compliance, including pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Check ventilator to make sure prescribed tidal volume is being delivered. Check for linked/crushed tubing. • Air Leaks Causing Low Pressure Alarms / Volume Loss: Assess, correct air leaks in endotracheal tube, tracheostomy cuff, ventilator system; recheck ventilator to make sure prescribed tidal volume is delivered • Ventilator Desynchrony: Agitation and respiratory distress that develop in a patient on a mechanical ventilator who has previously appeared comfortable represents an important clinical circumstance that requires a thorough assessment and an organized approach. The patient should not always be automatically re-sedated but must instead be evaluated for several potentially life-threatening developments that can present in this fashion • Lung Hyperinflation Air Trapping and Auto-PEEP: Dynamic hyperinflation is associated with positive end- expiratory alveolar pressure, or auto-PEEP. The physiologic effects include decreased cardiac preload because of diminished venous return into the chest. The reduced cardiac output that results from the reduction in preload can lead to hypotension and, if severe, to Pulseless Electrical Activity and cardiac arrest. Dynamic hyperinflation can also lead to local alveolar overdistention and rupture. Prevent, manage lung hyperinflation by decreasing tidal volume, changing inspiratory and expiratory phase parameters, switching to another mode, and correcting physiological abnormalities that increase airway resistance • Document Procedure, Results, and Vital Signs",

    "text": "         Post-Resuscitation Care6 Resuscitated MWDs will require intensive care to optimize long-term outcome. Many MWDs will arrest again, and most do so in the first 4 hours after resuscitation.2,3 Successful return of spontaneous circulation and resuscitation are unlikely if an MWD arrests again, and HCPs should balance resources against repeated attempts at resuscitation. Key management issues for MWDs in the post-resuscitation phase follow. • Control seizures that develop with diazepam or midazolam (0.3 mg/kg; IV, IO, or intranasally), repeated every 15-30 minutes if necessary. If available, give phenobarbital (15 mg/kg IV or IO) loading dose, and 2.5 mg/kg IV every 12 hours thereafter if seizures persist or status epilepticus develops. • Prevent and reduce cerebral edema. Use mannitol (1 gram/kg, IV, twice, 4-6 hrs apart), avoid hyperventila­ tion, give a single dose of dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg IV) or methylprednisolone sodium succinate (30 mg/kg, IV, once), avoid jugular vein compression, and maintain normoxemia and normotension. • Maintain adequate ventilation, maintaining a patent airway and using manual IPPV at 8-10 breaths per minute, targeting an ETCO2 of 25-60 mmHg. • Maintain adequate oxygenation, targeting a SpO2 > 95% using supplemental oxygen for a minimum of 12 hours. • Maintain normotension using IV fluids in bolus challenges, targeting a MAP > 65 mmHg or Sys > 90 mmHg. Isotonic crystalloids at 10-15 mL/kg over 15 minutes are usually effective. • Use synthetic colloids if 2-3 bolus challenges do not achieve normotension. Give 2-3 bolus challenges of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) at 10 mL/kg over 15 minutes. Once normotension is achieved, give crystalloid IV fluids at 3-5 mL/kg/hour for maintenance. Given the dismal outcome in post-resuscitation MWDs that require vasopressor support, there is no role in the deployed setting for vasopressor therapy in MWDs in the post-resuscitation phase. • Control pathologic ventricular arrhythmias with a lidocaine CRI (50-75 mcg/kg/min). • Do not attempt tight control of blood glucose with insulin. Supplement IV fluids if hypoglycemia is present (5% dextrose), but avoid hyperglycemia. • There is no role for therapeutic hypothermia in MWDs during the post-resuscitation period. Avoid hyper­ thermia; tolerate mild hypothermia (>92° F) if it develops. Discontinuation of CPR CPR should be discontinued 1) if the animal is successfully resuscitated, 2) if the senior HCP directs that efforts cease, or 3) if effective CPR has been attempted for at least 20 minutes without success. Resuscitative Thoracostomy and Open-Chest CPR There is no role for open-chest CPR by HCPs in MWDs. Euthanasia is indicated for any MWD for which a resus­ citative thoracostomy is deemed necessary to manage CPR (See Chapter 21). 32 Post-Resuscitation Care",

Ensure that patient has their ETCO2 monitored after administration. o Ketamine 4-5mg/kg IM/IN or 1-2 mg/kg IV/IO can repeat q 10min. o Lorazepam 2-4mg IV/IM (can use alone). o Midazolam 2.5-5mg IV/IM q15-30 min prn (larger patients may need 10mg if using IM route). • If patient is still combative after the use of medications, consider RSI guideline. Notes, Warnings, Cautions • Physical restraints such as tying down patient hands to prevent pulling lines, etc., should be limited to the least amount necessary to accomplish treatments / prevent injuries. (Kerlix gauze can be a useful restraint) o Do not jeopardize the patient’s airway! – Avoid hog tying, lying prone in restraints, sandwiching between spine boards, etc. o Check Vitals, SpO2, Pulse and Cap Refill every 5 minutes. • Combative patients present a very real threat to the safety of themselves, the medic, and the aircrew during flight. For this reason, any patient with altered mental status and the potential for combativeness that would threaten aircrew safety or themselves should be prophylactically sedated and/or paralyzed and intubated for the flight. • Use of sedative medications adds risk of decreasing respiratory drive and should be used with caution. However, meds should be titrated to adequate dosage to control patient. Be prepared for airway interventions/vomiting if used. Cardiac arrest in patients with excited delirium/extreme agitation following restraint is well documented. Capnography in addition to cardiac monitoring is essential.",

The temperature of intravenous fluids should not exceed 108° F to avoid injury to cellular components of the peripheral blood.1,5 • If the MWD is intubated and warming humidifiers are available on anesthesia circuits, use warmed inhaled air. • Given potential complications with use, HCPs should not use warm peritoneal or pleural lavage or urinary bladder or rectal lavage with warmed fluids. • Warm hypothermic MWDs to a temperature of 98.5° F, and then cease use of all warming methods except passive warming, while providing blood volume support (i.e., IV fluids) at relatively moderate rates to avoid volume overload (10-15 mL/kg/h) that is possible due to earlier cold diuresis 1,5 in hypo­ thermic MWDs being rewarmed. Complications Related to Hypothermia • It is most important for the HCPs to recognize potential problems rather than specific temperatures at which to expect these problems. • Hyperglycemia is common in mild and moderate hypothermia; specific measures to reduce blood sugar are seldom necessary. Hypoglycemia can develop in severely hypothermic patients, and dextrose supple­ mentation (5% in IV fluids) is recommended empirically. • Hypokalemia is common in mild-to-moderate hypothermia, and supplementation is necessary (KCl in IV fluids, 20 mEq/L) empirically. Hyperkalemia is reported in severe hypothermia; specific measures (e.g., insulin-dextrose administration, bicarbonate administration) may be necessary if potassium is >7-8 mmol/ L. Check electrolytes, if able. • Metabolic and respiratory acidosis are reported in most types and degrees of hypothermia; these typically correct with fluid therapy and patient warming. • Hemostatic defects are common. MWDs are commonly in a hypocoagulable state with prolonged clotting times, and platelet abnormalities are also noted. Monitor for bleeding diasthesis. Given the inability to correct coagulopathies and thrombocytopenias in MWDs in the deployed setting, any MWD with evidence of bleeding should be evacuated URGENTLY to a veterinary facility. • Tachycardia and hypertension are common in mild-to-moderate hypothermia.

Most MWDs require a 9-11 mm ID endotracheal tube. Use a cuffed tube. • Maintain anesthesia using ISOFLURANE 0.5-1.5% titrated to effect in 100% oxygen or SEVOFLURANE 2.0-2.5% titrated to effect in 100% oxygen or PROPOFOL CRI 100-300 mcg/kg/min. • Manage pain with HYDROMORPHONE 0.1 mg/kg IV boluses, not to exceed 0.2 mg/kg per hour. • Monitor appropriately, give IV fluids, and keep the MWD warm (See Ancillary Support in this chapter, and Table 20 on the next page). Effective Analgesia Protocols for MWDs Assessment of pain in dogs is difficult. Dogs are generally very stoic and often hide or fail to show outward signs of pain. HCPs should err on side of providing analgesia – if performed properly, it is safe and effective, and analgesia is critically important for safe handling and alleviation of pain. • Note that all protocols have analgesia incorporated into them. Additional analgesia can be provided by the IV, IM, or PO route, as necessary. • Scheduled administration of analgesics in the post-procedure period is preferred to as needed admin­ istration in dogs, because pain can be difficult to assess and to avert the ‘roller coaster‘ effect of unman­ aged pain. • For intermittent IV or IM supplementary analgesia, use one of the following drugs: • HYDROMORPHONE 0.1-0.2 mg/kg q2-4h. • MORPHINE 0.2-0.5 mg/kg q4-6h • For CRI supplementary analgesia, use one of the following drugs: • FENTANYL 2-10 mcg/kg/h. • MORPHINE 0.1-0.25 mg/kg/h. • HYDROMORPHONE 0.02-0.05 mg/kg/h. • For PO supplementary analgesia, use TRAMADOL 5-10 mg/kg PO q8-12h for up to 5 days. Caution: Do NOT use acetaminophen or ibuprofen in MWDs, as these drugs can cause liver toxicity. AVOID use of NSAIDs such as naproxen, meloxicam, and aspirin in emergently ill or injured MWDs. Opioid Reversal At appropriate doses, dogs appear less susceptible to opioid-induced respiratory depression and excessive se­ dation. However, opioid side effects can be reversed in the dog using NALOXONE 0.01-0.02 mg/kg slow IV to effect if needed. Note that this will reverse analgesia as well as sedation!

Diagnostic Imaging Radiographs, CT, or MRI are often necessary for definitive diagnosis in patients with fractures or dislocations to determine the site of injury. If these imaging modalities are available and the MWD can be managed without worsening possible injury, attempt imaging (See Chapter 20). Heavy sedation or anesthesia will be necessary (See Chapter 16). General Management Considerations for Patients with ASCI Goals are to reduce neurological deficit and prevent further loss of neurological function (See Figure 46). • Follow guidance in this CPG for management of shock, hypotension, hypovolemia, hemorrhage control, and respiratory dysfunction. Be prepared to intubate patients that are not breathing or have depressed ventila­ tion. Careful intubation using manual in-line stabilization (MILS) is essential to minimize further injury. • If signs suggest ASCI are present and the MWD is NOT ambulatory, immobilize the MWD using a backboard (plywood sheet, plastic board, EMS backboard, etc.) to which the animal is taped, and sedate with or with­ out analgesia as often as necessary to prevent unwanted patient movement due to anxiety and pain. • If signs suggest ASCI is present and the MWD IS ambulatory or adequate immobilization is not possible (due to lack of sedative/analgesia or support devices or patient temperament), confine the MWD to a small area or kennel and prevent excessive movement until evacuated. • Do NOT use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). • Do NOT give corticosteroids to MWDs with ASCI, UNLESS the animal has no deep or superficial pain, is paralyzed, or the neurological condition deteriorates. If corticosteroids are given, use ONLY a SINGLE dose of methylprednisolone sodium succinate, IV, 30 mg/kg over 15 minutes. Conservative Management of ASCI Indications for conservative (non-surgical) treatment include patients that are ambulatory or paraparetic, and patients that have strong voluntary movement and peripheral pain sensation. • Maintain enforced confinement, analgesia, and sedation as needed to minimize movement. • Evacuate URGENTLY if feasible. Surgical Management of ASCI Early definitive surgical correction is indicated in non-ambulatory patients, patients with palpably unstable or displaced injuries, patients that deteriorate with conservative therapy, patients with peripheral pain sensation but no voluntary movements, and patients requiring decompressive surgery to correct displaced or fractured TBI and ASCI 90",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS 45 Continued from: Tactical Evacuation Guideline Pearls: • Duration of symptoms should be determined as accurately as possible. Family members / colleagues can be helpful. If pt awaken with symptoms – onset time est. from last time patient was seen “normal.” • Be alert for airway problem / risk of aspiration. If concerned, request intubation before departure. • Hypoglycemia can mimic stroke / TIA. May present with focal neurologic deficit, especially in the elderly. • EKG should be obtained in all patients to evaluate for arrhythmia – especially atrial fibrillation. • All TIAs should be transferred for evaluation, even if symptoms abated – these patients have 10% risk of stroke within 30 days. • Aspirin should not be given to patients for suspected stroke. Aspirin use is a contraindication to the use of thrombolytics for stroke. • All strokes/TIAs are not associated with motor findings. Although uncommon, pure sensory strokes can occur. More frequently, very subtle motor abnormalities are present that the patient may not note. • Systolic greater than 185 or Diastolic greater than 110: give Labetalol 10-20 mg IV for 1-2 minutes. May repeat 1 time. • Aim for no more than a 20% reduction in MAP. MAP = [(2 x Diastolic) + Systolic] / 3 For additional info see: ALS Acute Coronary Syndromes and Stroke. Prehospital Stroke Scale: any 1 abnormal finding = 72% chance of stroke Facial Droop (show teeth and smile) • Abnormal when one side of face does not move equally with opposite side. Arm Drift (close eyes and extend both arms) • Abnormal when one arm drifts down compared to opposite arm (arms move separately).

If the hematocrit and total protein concentration are similar, significant hemorrhage into the abdomen is probable, and surgical intervention may be necessary, but base this decision on the patient’s status more than the actual number. If the hematocrit and total protein concentration of the abdominal fluid are very low, minor hemorrhage is more likely, and a more conservative approach – based on the patient’s status – is recommended. • The presence of bilirubin suggests gall bladder injury, although this may not be present for several days after trauma.9 Amylase or lipase with values higher than systemic circulation suggests pancreatic trauma. A ratio of 1.4:1 in comparing abdominal fluid potassium with peripheral blood potassium concentrations has 100% sensitivity and specificity for uroperitoneum.12 Comparison of abdominal fluid creatinine to peripheral blood creatinine concentrations shows 86% sensitivity and 100% specificity for ratios >2:1.12 Elevated ALT suggests direct liver injury, and elevated ALKP suggests bowel injury or ischemia, but these are non-specific and can rarely be used to guide management decisions. Consider diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) in any MWD in which major abdominal trauma is suspected, but AFAST and abdominocentesis are unrewarding.9 If available, CT or MRI may be better modalities. • Use a specialized DPL catheter or aseptically fenestrate a large bore over-the-needle (OTN) catheter. • Sedate the patient if necessary and locally anesthetize the site of catheter insertion using 20 mg lidocaine. • Percutaneously insert the catheter; a small stab incision may be needed if a larger catheter is used. • Immediately after entering the abdominal cavity, remove the needle and advance the catheter in a caudodorsal direction to avoid the omentum and cranial abdominal organs. • Infuse 20 mL/kg warmed, sterile saline aseptically over 5-10 minutes. • Aseptically plug the catheter and gently roll the MWD from side to side for several minutes to allow the infusate to mix. • Either aspirate effluent or allow gravity-dependent drainage to collect a sample for analysis. • Analyze the sample for the same parameters described for abdominocentesis. Blunt Abdominal Trauma (BAT) The usual organs in MWDs subjected to blunt trauma are the spleen, liver, and urinary bladder, in this order of frequency.

    "text": "       Inhalation Injury Burn patients may have significant inhalation injury. Clinical signs of inhalation and pulmonary injuries may not manifest for several hours. Clinical signs of inhalation injury include stertor or stridor, harsh cough or upper airway sounds, coughing, production of dark sputum, tachypnea, and respiratory distress. MWDs with inhalation injury should be observed closely for need for orotracheal intubation or (uncommonly) tracheosto­ my to manage the airway. Intubate or perform tracheostomy for any MWD with observed respiratory distress or if in doubt about the patency of the airway (See Chapter 3). Estimation of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) Burn Extent in Dogs Determine the severity of the burn once the MWD has been resuscitated and stabilized. General characteris­ tics of the wound that are important to examine include color, texture, presence or absence of pain, moist­ ness, and extent of swelling, if present. Estimate the percent of the total body surface area (TBSA) that is burned by using a modification of the “Rule of 9s” used for humans:4 ADD the estimated percent of burn from EACH of the following body areas: • Head and neck (H/N) – 9% • Chest (C) – 18% • Abdomen (A) – 18% • Each forelimb (L FL, R FL) – 9% • Each hindlimb (L HL, R HL) – 18% For example, the estimated TBSA burn for a dog with burns to the chest and abdomen and left forelimb would be 18% (chest) + 18% (abdomen) + 9% (L FL) = 45%. The percent TBSA is important in assessing severity, anticipating problems, and determining prognosis. Patients with TBSA >20% often have severe metabolic problems (e.g., hypovolemic shock, albumin and electrolyte losses, acidoses, renal failure); patients with TBSA >50% have a poor prognosis.4 Any discussion of prognosis must take into consideration not only the TBSA but also the severity of burn. Note that initial evaluation of severity of burn wound may be inaccurate, as wounds often progress over a period of 3-7 days before completely manifesting ultimate severity.4-5 General Patient Management Recommendations4-6 • Monitor and treat for complications related to burn injury, to include shock, fluid losses, respiratory problems, and electrolyte abnormalities, see appropriate chapters. Stabilize the patient first. Manage pain using appropriate analgesics (See Chapter 16 and Table 16). • Cool the burned skin using cool water (45-65° F) by immersion, application of compresses, or gentle spray for at least 30 minutes. Do not apply ice to any burned skin, as the vasoconstriction it causes may impede wound healing and may worsen the extent of tissue damage. Measure the patient’s rectal or esophageal temperature frequently to monitor for and prevent hypothermia. Blast, Burn and Crush Injuries 68",

SUGGESTED PROGNOSES BASED ON MODIFIED VETERINARY GLASGOW COMA SCALE 7 MVGCS Score Suggested Prognosis 3-8 Grave 9-14 Guarded 15-18 Good General Management Considerations for MWDs with TBI It is critical to ensure adequate resuscitation and management of cardiovascular and respiratory problems, as hypotension, poor tissue perfusion, and hypoxia lead to progressive brain injury due to the adverse effects of secondary neurological injury due to ischemia, cerebral edema, reperfusion injury, and so forth. (See Figure 48 on the next page.) • Follow guidance in this CPG for management of shock, hypotension, hypovolemia, hemorrhage control, and respiratory dysfunction. • Be prepared to intubate patients that are not breathing or have depressed ventilation; careful intubation using manual in-line stabilization (MILS) is essential to minimize further injury. • Focus care on preventing hypoxemia, maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure and systemic arterial pres­ sure in the normal ranges, and preventing secondary ischemic cerebral injury. • Provide 100% oxygen by facemask. Monitor respiratory rate and effort. Be prepared to intubate and provide supplemental oxygen by ET tube. Maintain arterial carbon dioxide content in the normal range using assisted manual ventilation. Avoid hyperventilation! • Maintain normotension (MAP 70-80 mmHg or systolic BP >90 mmHg). Start IV crystalloid fluid therapy to correct shock and provide ongoing volume support (See Chapter 6, Figure 33). Measure blood pres­ sure if possible; otherwise, guide fluid therapy based on presence or absence of distal pulses. Consider hypertonic saline (4 mL/kg IV over 5 min) or hyperoncotic fluid (HES, 10 mL/kg IV) boluses if hypoten­ sion persists despite crystalloid use. • Nurse with head elevated 300 with neutral neck position, avoid external jugular vein compression and catheters, avoid procedures that stimulate coughing or sneezing. • If evacuation will be prolonged and the patient is recumbent, rotate lateral recumbency and lubricate the eyes with ophthalmic ointment every 4 hours and maintain in a well-padded area. • If the MWD is conscious, restrict activity and movement (e.g., portable kennel), which may require se­ dation and analgesia (See Chapter 16).

    "text": "      CHAPTER 6 Shock Management Shock in deployed MWDs will most likely be due to hemorrhage from trauma or hypovolemia due to heat in­ jury or gastrointestinal losses. Control bleeding (if present) and then stabilize the patient using targeted fluid therapy. Figure 33 provides a clinical management algorithm for shock management in MWDs. Immediate Hemorrhage Control Treatment by handlers and combat medics may have been performed, with varying degrees of success.1,2 Expect dogs to arrive with pressure dressings, hemostatic gauze packed into wounds, and improvised tourni­ quets. Expect untreated or inadequately treated extremity hemorrhage, and suspect “hidden” intracavitary hemorrhage in the chest and abdomen. • Assess for unrecognized hemorrhage and control all sources of external bleeding. Use direct pressure initially, or rapidly clamp and ligate major vessels if traumatized. Dogs have excellent collateral circulation, and paired major vessels can be ligated without concern for tissue ischemia or edema, to include the fem­ oral arteries and veins, external jugular veins, external carotid arteries, and brachial arteries and veins.3,4 • Tourniquets are unreliable on the limbs of dogs due to the anatomic shape of the leg. Conventional hu­ man tourniquets do not remain in place or effectively control hemorrhage. Some success is reported in use of improvised tourniquets, such as surgical rubber tubing or constrictive gauze bandage. If delay in definitive care of major extremity trauma is expected, use hemostatic agents, direct pressure, and com­ pressive bandaging to assist with hemorrhage control. • Use thoracic FAST (TFAST) and abdominal FAST (AFAST) to rapidly scan for intracavitary fluid (See Chapter 4 and Chapter 7).5,6 Assume intracavitary fluid is due to bleeding until proven otherwise. Clinical Signs of Shock in MWDs7,8 Dogs in shock are amazing in how stable they appear on initial presentation, due to compensatory mecha­ nisms. • MWDs in early (compensatory) shock may have tachycardia, tachypnea, alert mentation, rapid arterial pulses with a normal or increased pulse pressure, decreased capillary refill time (< 2 seconds), and normal or bright red mucous membranes. While this MWD seems normal, it is already in compensatory shock. Immediate treatment at this point may stop the progression of shock. • As the early decompensatory phase of shock begins, tachycardia persists, pulse pressure and quality be­ gins to drop or may be normal, capillary refill time becomes prolonged, mucous membranes appear pale or blanched, peripheral body temperature drops, and mental depression develops. Aggressive treatment must be provided to halt ongoing shock. • As late decompensatory shock develops, the heart rate drops despite a decreased cardiac output, capil­ lary refill time is very prolonged or absent, pulses are poor or absent, both peripheral and core tempera­ ture is very low, and marked mental depression (stupor) is present. Irreversible cellular injury may be pre­ sent to such a severe degree that despite aggressive measures at this point, many patients will die. Shock Management 35",

Administer intravenous fluids to targeted endpoints (See Chapter 6, Figure 33). • Decompress the stomach by percutaneous trocarization of the stomach: • Position yourself on the left side of the patient, or lay the dog with its left side down (left lateral recumbency). • Locate the insertion point: • Palpate the last rib. • Move the hand 2 inches caudal to the last rib, midway between the spine and the ventral border of the abdomen on the right side. • Auscult the lateral abdominal wall at the most distended area while percussing (flicking) the abdominal wall firmly with a finger. This percussion will elicit a \"pinging\" sound, and the site of insertion of the trocar should be at the point of loudest \"pinging.\" • Clip the hair over a 6-inch X 6-inch area over this area. Prepare the area using surgical scrub. • Forcefully insert a 10-14 gauge trocar or 14-18 gauge IV over-the-needle catheter through the skin, abdominal wall, and stomach wall. Note gas or air escaping through the trocar/needle from the stomach to signify a successful trocarization. • Note: If no air or gas is coming from the trocar, attempt gastric trocarization one more time. If still unsuccessful, do not attempt any further trocarizations. Emergent surgery is indicated if trocarisation is not possible. • Gently apply external pressure to the abdominal wall to assist in decompressing air from the stomach. • Once the majority of the air is evacuated, remove the trocar/needle, because leaving it inserted may cause trauma to internal organs. Common Complications Associated with GDV Monitor for the most common complications seen in MWDs with GDV, to include ventricular arrhythmias, persistent shock, recurrent gastric dilation, nausea and vomiting, ileus, electrolyte abnormalities (especially potassium), and metabolic acidosis.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) or ɛ-aminocaproic acid (EACA) may be helpful in dogs with catastrophic hemorrhage. 1. Place multiple large-bore IV or IO catheters or perform venous cut-down. • Do not delay in placing catheters. The IO route is rapid, reliable and safe — USE IT! Place peripheral or central lines when feasible. If one percutaneous attempt is not successful in a shock patient, immedi­ ately choose an alternate percutaneous site and also begin an immediate venous cutdown or perform IO catheterization. The cephalic veins and external jugular veins are ideal for peripheral catheterization. • The proximal cranial medial tibia and the proximal lateral humerus are ideal for IO catheter placement, using the same technique as for people (See Figures 34-37). Most MWDs weigh >40#, so use adult (25mm X 15 gauge) IO catheters. Use pediatric (15mm X 15 gauge) IO catheters in dogs weighing less than 40#. 2. Give crystalloid fluids as the first-line treatment.9-14 • Normosol-R® or Plasmalyte-A® are optimal for dogs; however, saline or LRS are acceptable in emergent cases. • Crystalloid fluid challenges, as needed based on response to therapy, are better than large volume fluid administration.11-13 Be prepared to administer up to 90 mL/kg of crystalloids in the first hour (1 blood volume for the dog). Aggressive, but careful, fluid delivery, with frequent reassessment of the patient‘s status, is critical. Most MWDs can be resuscitated with much less than this calculated maximum volume. • For quick reference, ADD a ZERO to the dog’s body weight (in pounds) to approximate a safe but effec­ tive bolus volume. For example, a 45# dog would need about a 450 mL bolus, and a 75# dog would need about 750 mL as a bolus. 3. Use synthetic colloids and hypertonic saline (HTS) in dogs with refractory shock. Very limited data in dogs suggest increased risks,15-18 but dogs do not seem as sensitive to the adverse effects of these fluids as are people. Two recent studies in dogs showed no adverse side effects, specifically acute kidney injury, with tetrastarch use.19,20 The benefits outweigh the risks, so be aggressive with synthetic colloid and HTS.15-17 • Give hydroxyethyl starch (HES) as an IV or IO bolus of 10-20 mL/kg total over 5-10 minutes if clinical signs of shock do not abate after the first 30 minutes or the first 2 bolus crystalloid challenges), or re­ sponse to crystalloid challenges is not sustained.11-13,15,20,21 Repeat this bolus if no response to therapy. • Use HTS IV boluses, if 7.0 - 7.5% HTS is available, for MWDs that fail to respond to 2 or 3 boluses of crystalloids and/or 1 or 2 boluses of HES. Give 4 mL/kg over 5 minutes.11-13,20 Do not administer HTS by the IO route. Shock Therapy 36",

    "text": "         Protocol Guidance All drug combinations use the intramuscular (IM) route for ease and safety. If used within 5 minutes, all drugs can be combined in the same syringe to simplify administration. Wait at least 20 minutes after administration before attempting any procedure, to allow maximal drug effect. Ideally, an IV catheter should be placed once feasible (See Chapter 2). Drug Dosing in Dogs Dosages for many analgesics in dogs are significantly higher than for people. Trust the doses provided in this chapter, and dose as directed to prevent inadequate analgesia or sedation and ‘wind up’ pain. Gastrointestinal Side Effects of Opioids Protocols include opioids, which in dogs typically causes emesis, often within 5 minutes of administration. Use caution and have the handler prepared to remove the muzzle to minimize aspiration risk. Mild Sedation Protocol • Use to relax MWDs for examination, handling, or short minor procedures that will not cause pain. Use to reduce anxiety. • Protocol: MIDAZOLAM 0.3 mg/kg IM and HYDROMORPHONE 0.2 mg/kg IM. • Expectations: The MWD will be calm, but reactive and noise sensitive. Deep Sedation Protocol • Use for procedures that can be completed in <30 minutes and do not require general anesthesia, such as clipping of hair, wound cleansing, minor wound debridement, splinting of lower limb fractures, bandage application or removal, ear cleaning, or radiography. First-line protocol for fractious MWDs. • Protocol: MIDAZOLAM 0.3 mg/kg IM and KETAMINE 5 mg/kg IM and HYDROMORPHONE 0.1 mg/kg IM. • If deeper sedation or light anesthesia is necessary, or to allow general anesthesia induction, use PROPOFOL in 1 mg/kg boluses IV as needed. • Expectations: The MWD will not be able to walk, cannot be intubated, can be aroused with stimulation, and maintains laryngeal and palpebral reflexes.

The dog‘s head is to the left; the dog is in right lateral recumbency. DH = diaphragmatic-hepatic SR = splenorenal CC = cystocolic HR = hepatorenal • Score the AFAST exam, with 1 point for each quadrant that has free fluid identified. Perform serial FAST exams every 4-6 hours and compare scores. MWDs with increasing scores should be monitored closely and prepared for URGENT evacuation or surgery, as exploratory surgery may be necessary for MWDs with scores of 3/4 or 4/48 or with clinical deterioration. Perform a 4-quadrant abdominocentesis in any patient with free fluid in the abdomen.9 This technique is quick and easy to perform, and usually differentiates abdominal hemorrhage or biliary or urinary tract injury. The general rule of thumb is that a positive peritoneal tap is a reliable indicator that some hemorrhage has oc­ curred or that free urine or bile is in the abdominal cavity, but that a negative tap does not rule these out. • Place the dog in lateral recumbency. Clip the abdomen of hair and prepare for aseptic procedure. • “Divide” the abdomen into 4 quadrants, and tap each quadrant sequentially, unless a positive yield is obtained in a quadrant. Perform abdominocentesis on the “down” quadrants, rolling the dog over for the opposite quadrants. • A large bore needle (18 or 20 gauge) is quickly inserted perpendicular to and through the body wall approximately 2 inches off the midline in each quadrant. Alternatively, a large bore over-the-needle catheter can be aseptically fenestrated and inserted into the abdomen. This increases the likelihood for higher yield because the fenestrations are less likely to occlude. • The presence of blood suggests intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and the presence of clear or yellowish fluid suggests urine. • As much sample is collected by gravity drip or slight suction with a 3 cc syringe and saved in serum tubes and EDTA tube. The fluid is analyzed cytologically, and for glucose, lactate, hematocrit, total protein concentration, BUN or creatinine, bilirubin, amylase or lipase, ALT, and ALKP. • Assess cytology for the presence of bacteria or other organisms, or fecal or food material that would suggest gastrointestinal rupture and contamination. • The peritoneal fluid glucose and lactate concentrations can be measured and compared to serum levels to aid in differentiating possible septic peritonitis in the absence of cytological evidence.

    "text": "        Rib Cage Trauma This includes flail chest, rib fractures, intercostal muscle rupture, and penetrating wounds. Signs mimic pleural space injury (restrictive breathing pattern). Usually the defect is obvious, especially if paradoxical chest wall motion is noted. • Adequate management usually involves careful handling, laying the patient with affected side down, mini­ mizing restrictive chest bandaging, and providing analgesia. External splinting or surgical management is usually not necessary unless injury is severe or extensive, or the chest wall is compromised and prolonged interference with gas exchange and ventilation is evident. • Pain can substantially interfere with gas exchange and ventilation. Alleviate pain once the patient is stabi­ lized to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Systemic or local analgesia are acceptable options (See Chapter 16). Local nerve/rib blocks and intrapleural analgesia administration work well and are readily ac­ complished. Pleural Space Trauma This includes PTX (open, closed, tension), hemothorax (HTX), and diaphragmatic hernia. A restrictive breathing pattern is the classic presentation—shallow, rapid respiration with muffled lung and/or heart sounds. Auscult the chest for decreased lung sounds over most of the thorax, which suggests either fluid (blood) or air in the pleural space, pulmonary contusions, or diaphragmatic hernia. • Open PTX requires immediate action. Rapidly clip hair from around the wound, and apply any occlusive seal over the wound. Apply a chest bandage to secure the material. Delay wound closure until the MWD is stable. Open PTX always requires chest decompression after closure of the wound. • The presence of decreased lung sounds in a trauma patient with signs of respiratory distress, or rapid clini­ cal deterioration in a MWD with respiratory distress is sufficient justification for needle thoracocentesis. • Thoracocentesis is readily and rapidly accomplished, and safe when performed properly – “When in doubt, tap it!” Figure 29 on the next page shows the location for needle thoracocentesis in dogs.13 See Table 8 for thoracocentesis technique in MWDs. • The mediastinum in dogs is thin and typically ruptures; therefore, always tap both sides of the chest, even if a positive tap is achieved on one side of the chest, as air will form pockets and will migrate. • Repeated thoracenteses may be required to stabilize the patient. A negative chest tap doesn‘t always mean there‘s not an abnormal accumulation of air or fluid in the pleural space – it may mean you just couldn‘t find it! “When in doubt, tap it again!” • In dogs, the intercostal artery, vein, and nerve run on the caudal aspect of each rib; thus, the best ap­ proach is by inserting the needle or catheter in the center of the intercostal space or at the cranial aspect of a rib.

    "text": "      Upper Airway Obstruction with Obstructive Breathing Pattern A patient with an obstructive breathing pattern typically has respiratory distress characterized by labored in­ spiration and abnormal upper airway noise such as stridor or stertor (See Figure 23). • Common causes in trauma patients are facial and oropharyngeal swelling (jaw fractures, facial trauma), cervical injury (tracheal compression by hemorrhage in neck area, muscle edema), direct tracheal injury, severe snake and insect envenomation, bite wounds, smoke inhalation, electrocution, and foreign ob­ jects. • Diagnosis is usually obvious based on history of trauma and presenting signs. For every trauma patient, carefully ensure the airway is open by physically opening the mouth, examining the oral cavity, and watching the patient breath. Palpate and examine the face, muzzle, nose, mouth, external laryngeal ar­ ea, and trachea for deformities, traumatic wounds, or other abnormalities • If the airway is not patent, immediately takes steps to open the airway (See Figure 25 next page). 1. Provide oxygen therapy as above. 2. Bypass the obstruction until the patient is more stable: 1) Attempt to remove the obstruction quickly by sweeping the mouth and pharyngeal area with a finger or gauze, suction the area, or use large forceps to remove objects that may be obstructing the passage. 2) Do not attempt a Heimlich maneuver unless you know the object is smooth (e.g., ball); most trau­ ma patients do not have a smooth foreign body obstruction, and the maneuver can cause signifi­ cant patient distress and possibly further injury. • If the obstruction cannot be removed in a few seconds, consider tracheal insufflation with oxygen for immediate oxygen delivery (See Table 4 for technique), and perform an emergency tracheostomy (See Table 5 for technique. • Patient anxiety is frequently a compounding factor; tranquilize, sedate, or anesthetize if necessary. • Management of patients with tracheostomy tubes requires 24-hour care and observation. Perform tracheal and pulmonary toilet as for human patients. Perform local wound care at least every 12 hours. Tube dislodgement is a potentially life-threatening complication that must be guarded against and monitored. Upper Airway Obstruction 10",

These usually will spontaneously cease bleeding given time and conservative fluid therapy. Monitor the MWD closely, as some will require exploratory laparotomy and surgical correction of hemorrhage, especially those that do not respond or deteriorate. • Given the difficulty in maintaining an abdominal counterpressure bandage, and the risk of respiratory compromise, do not apply an abdominal counterpressure bandage on a MWD. • Patients with massive intra-abdominal bleeding need surgery to find the site of bleeding and surgically correct the loss of blood. There may be instances in which emergent laparatomy is necessary by HCPs to afford a chance at patient survival. See Emergent Abdominal Laparotomy in this chapter for guidance. • Urinary tract trauma. Urinary bladder rupture, with uroperitoneum, is fairly common, especially if the animal had not voided before the trauma. • MWDs with acute urologic trauma and uroperitoneum should be stabilized for other injuries, and aggressively managed for shock. Primary repair of a ruptured urinary bladder or other urologic injury must wait until the patient stabilizes to minimize the risk of complications associated with taking an unstable patient to surgery. • In many cases, urologic injury is not apparent for several days after trauma, so a high index of suspicion must be maintained. Special studies (ultrasound, excretory urography, contrast urethrocystography) may need to be performed to rule out urologic trauma. • In patients with known urologic tears and urine leakage, abdominal drains may be indicated if surgery is delayed for several days while the patient stabilizes. This will allow removal of urine, which will mini­ mize chemical peritonitis and electrolyte and acid-base imbalances (metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia). Intensive fluid therapy to correct or prevent electrolyte and acid-base imbalances is often necessary, especially if several days have passed since traumatic injury. • Surgical repair must only be performed after the patient is stabilized. Patients with severe uroabdomen need surgery to define the extent of injury and correct the problem.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non-Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 5: Psychopharmacological Interventions in Forward Locations 4 The CENTCOM formulary is reviewed quarterly by service component surgeons, and contains CPG-supported behavioral health medications such as SSRIs, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines (BZD), and CNS stimulants. However the CENTCOM formulary does not have the same breadth and depth of these classes as a Continental U.S. (CONUS) MTF formulary or a retail pharmacy. This needs to be taken into account as a planning factor in the treatment of both acute and chronic behavioral health conditions. Additionally, in accordance with MOD15, medication resupply for service members requiring ongoing behavioral health medications is executed by the Tricare Mail Order Program (TMOP), not deployed pharmacies. As a result, Role 3 pharmacies may have limited quantities of behavioral health medications on hand. There are limited behavioral health medication options at most Role I or aid stations far-forward in the deployed theater. Role 1 Capabilities are usually constrained to trauma care and forward resuscitation. The Army recently published a new health systems doctrine with a more expeditionary, modular organizational structure. This includes psychiatric care in hospital augmentation detachments and a medical company area support (MCAS) battalion psychiatrist, which are considered Role 2. However Joint Doctrine still aligns behavioral health treatment as a theater hospitalization or Role 3 capability. Given the cold-chain storage requirements for injectable lorazepam, olanzapine ODT (Zyprexa Zydis) disintegrating tablet (which would be first line if verbal redirection is not effective for agitation), Haldol intramuscular (IM) injectable (second line if verbal redirection ineffective and patient refuses olanzapine ODT) with Benadryl IM (to potentially be given with Haldol for increased sedation and decrease likelihood of dystonia) may be the only options for acute pharmacological intervention. These items may not be stocked at Role 1 though. If necessary, the Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) representative can assist with ordering approved medications, with the reminder that chronic, ongoing behavioral medications should be resupplied to the service member through TMOP and require a MOD15 waiver. If a controlled substance is required for chronic care, TMOP requires that a hardcopy prescription is mailed to them in CONUS, along with the approved MOD15 waiver. Aid Bag There is no standard list of medications for an aid bag that is carried by the combat medic or Navy corpsman. There are several references medics use to inform their medication selection list to carry. A conventional force combat medic is likely to carry Joint Trauma Services Clinical Practice Guideline (JTS CPG) compliant medications. These usually include ketamine, tranexamic acid (TXA), calcium, acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen, morphine, diphenhydramine (Benadryl), midazolam (Versed), some antibiotics, and other medications. Every combat medic (conventional force and special operations medics) is likely to have ketamine, and may have BZD like midazolam in accordance with the JTS CPGs. This list is not standardized beyond the references mentioned. Accordingly, many medics will try to balance medication choices against the limited space they have in their very small aid bag, and medications that are perceived to serve two purposes are better than medications that serve a single purpose. Additionally, reports from the field indicate that ketamine and midazolam are being used for behavioral intervention in the field, which is not their primary indication. Ketamine has the potential of causing dissociation and midazolam may cause disinhibition while attempting to stabilize an agitated patient with these two medications. The potential risk of using a midazolam, a BZD, if the service member has alcohol or opioids in their system is respiratory arrest and death. Accordingly, it is highly recommended that an antipsychotic is included in the aid bag for cases of severe agitation. As mentioned earlier, olanzapine ODT disintegrating tablets, or haloperidol IM would be good candidates for inclusion. Treatments Pharmacologic treatment of any condition anywhere has a risk of inducing side effects, which might be unpleasant or might put the treated service member in danger. Consequently, and especially in a far-forward situation, this balance between benefits and side effects needs to be assessed carefully before starting medications. Oftentimes, behavioral interventions might work adequately enough until either the underlying condition has resolved or the service member has been transferred to a higher role. Generally, it is preferred that the decision to initiate any psychiatric medications are made in consultation with the behavioral health prescriber.",

Wash hands thoroughly before handling patients; wear clean exam gloves (superficial burns, superficial partial-thickness burns) or sterile surgical gloves (deep partial-thickness burns, full-thickness burns); do not contact wounds with things such as personal clothing, stethoscopes, or other instruments or monitors; wear barrier protection when handling deep partial- thickness burns and full-thickness burns; change gloves and wash hands before handling other burn wounds and invasive devices on the same patient. Follow strict aseptic technique when placing invasive devices and use clean examination gloves whenever handling catheters, adapters, fluid lines, etc. Unless absolutely necessary, do not place invasive devices through burned skin. Provide antibiotic coverage using the guidelines in Chapter 14 only for MWDs pre­ sumed to be immunocompromised, with pneumonia or acute lung injury, or with sepsis or suspected sep­ sis • Provide excellent nursing care. Turn or rotate the MWD every 4 hours if recumbent, and perform Passive Range of Motion (PROM) exercises of all limbs except burned limbs every 4 hours. Provide soft, padded bedding. Prevent urine scalding and fecal soiling. Allow MWDs to eat and drink if able. • Depending on severity and extent of burn, the patient may require daily heavy sedation or general anes­ thesia to allow debridement and management. Extreme care must be taken to monitor burn patients adequately during sedation or anesthesia (See Table 16). • Superficial or superficial partial-thickness burns are generally managed with daily cool water lavage, followed by topical silver sulfadiazine cream application until healed or the wound worsens. • Deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns need varying degrees of daily wound debridement. This may be accomplished by use of conservative debridement, chemical debridement, or surgical debridement. • Conservative debridement of deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns involves hydrotherapy using sterile saline lavage under light pressure or application of a wet-to-dry saline dressing under a light bandage for several hours, followed by removal of obvious necrotic or dead tissue using aseptic technique. Surgical debridement may be necessary in very deep or widespread wounds to more aggressively remove necrotic tissue; however, HCPs should not routinely perform surgical debridement – MWDs should be evacuated to veterinary facilities for this level of care. • Following debridement, apply silver sulfadiazine (SSD) cream, petrolatum, or hydrogel dressings in a thin layer directly on the wound and cover the burn with a non-adherent dressing (if the wound area is bandaged) or leave the burn uncovered (if bandaging is not permissible due to wound size or location). • Bandage burn wounds if the burn area is amendable to application (i.e., the bandage can be placed without increasing patient discomfort, the burn area is relatively small, and the bandage will not increase the po­ tential for wound injury). If there is any doubt about whether to bandage a burn wound or not, it is better to leave the wound unbandaged. In most cases, a wet-to-wet bandage is recommended to keep wounds moist and improve comfort. Change bandages at least daily or more often if wound exudate is excessive or the bandage becomes soiled.

    "text": "positional aids). CT slices should be acquired perpendicular to joint spaces, which may require gantry rotation if the joint is the focus of the study. Bone and standard algorithms should be performed along the affected re­ gion with slice thicknesses of 1.25 mm. If a joint the focus of the study, conducting an additional bone algo­ rithm sequence with a slice thickness of 0.625 mm is required (if available). Sagittal and dorsal reconstructions of the affected limb only are required. Magnetic Resonance Imaging5 Magnetic resonance imaging protocols used in veterinary medicine are more simplified compared to human medicine. However, current protocols are adequate in assessing for the majority of diseases of concern. Anesthesia Use either an MRI-safe anesthetic machine or constant rate IV anesthesia protocols (See Chapter 16). Patient monitoring presents challenges in the MR gantry due to increased noise, greater chance of hypothermia, and overall decreased patient accessibility. MRI Technician Assistance It is very important for the Veterinary Corps Officer to be present during image acquisition (if available) to help determine the beginning and end points (range) of the study in each plane, due to anatomic differences be­ tween humans and dogs (humans have five lumbar vertebrae compared to seven in dogs, for instance). Begin­ ning and end points for the study should be based on neurolocalization. MRI Contrast Administration Paramagnetic contrast agents are commonly used during MRI. Contrast agent administration is always re­ quired when imaging the brain, and may be necessary for other exams dependent on the case. For example, if neoplasia or diskospondylitis of the spine is suspected, then administration of contrast during a spinal exam is warranted. All pre-contrast sequences must be performed prior to contrast bolus administration. The contrast agent most often used in MWDs for MRI is gadolinium-based, and the dose for IV bolus use in the dog is 0.1 mmol/kg (0.2mL/kg). As a quick rule of thumb, 1 mL per 10 pounds body weight is the appropriate dose. MRI Protocols MRI Brain The patient should be positioned in ventral recumbency with the head encased within an effective coil (often head or cardiac types). Studies should extend from the most cranial limit of the orbits/eyes to the level of the 2nd or 3rd cervical vertebra. Slice thicknesses of 3-5 mm should be used; dependent on how many sequences you have time to perform. The following sequences in each respective plane should be performed: Diagnostic Imaging 105",

MV may be necessary if MIPPV fails or duration of ventilator support is expected to be >6 hours. Providers must note that MV should be considered only if the provider has the necessary advanced MV training and experience, the provider feels there is a reasonable likelihood of success, and the provider has the necessary support staff, facilities, and monitoring and intensive care facilities to manage a MWD on MV without compromising human patient care. Thus, MV should be considered only in Level 2 or higher medical facilities and by trained specialists with adequate staff. • Generally, it is best to induce general anesthesia and initially manage the ventilated dog using Controlled Ventilation or Assist-Control ventilator mode.

Clip the hair from and surgically prepare a 6 inch X 6 inch square area of skin on the mid-lateral as­ pect of the thorax centered between the 6th to 8th ribs. • If pneumothorax is suspected, prepare the thoracenteses sites at the junctions of the upper 1/3rd and lower 2/3rds of the thoracic wall. • If pleural effusion is suspected, prepare the thoracenteses sites at the costochondral junctions. 3. In conscious MWDs and if time, infiltrate 1 mL of local anesthetic (20 mg lidocaine or 5 mg bupiva­ caine) in the skin to the pleura. 4. Assemble an emergency thoracocentesis set. For a tension PTX, a 1-1.5 inch, 16-18 gauge over-the­ needle catheter is sufficient to relieve tension. For other types of PTX, use a 1-1.5 inch, 18 gauge over -the-needle catheter, to which sterile extension tubing and a stopcock and 60 cc syringe are attached; this allows aspiration of air and fluid without iatrogenic PTX. Do NOT use the standard Needle De­ compression Device (3.25 inch, 16 gauge), as risk of cardiac or pulmonary vessel trauma is high. 5. Hold the needle with the thumb and index finger of one hand and brace the hand on the lateral as­ pect of the thorax by firmly resting the \"knife\" of the hand on the thorax near the proposed thoracocentesis site. 6. Hold the syringe in your dominant hand, or have an assistant manipulate the syringe and stopcock while you manipulate the needle. The syringe should be empty and the stopcock closed to room air. 7. While stabilizing the hand holding the needle, insert the needle at the proposed thoracocentesis site through the skin, intercostal muscles, and parietal pleura until ½ the length of the needle has been inserted. 8. While stabilizing the depth of the needle with your non-dominant hand, aspirate with the syringe plunger in an attempt to remove air or fluid. 9. If you are successful in removing air or fluid, close the stopcock to the patient and expel the contents from the syringe through the stopcock without removing the needle from the pleural space or breaking aseptic technique. 10. Repeat until no further air or fluid can be removed. 11. If you are not successful in removing air or fluid, insert the needle to the hub while aspirating with the syringe, or redirect the needle cranially, caudally, dorsally and ventrally, or do both in an attempt to tap a pocket of air or fluid. 12.

Protect burn wounds: • Apply silver sulfadiazine cream in a thin layer directly on the wound. • Apply a light protective bandage, if the burn area is amendable to application. Crush Injury and Crush Syndrome • Crush injury is defined as injury due to compression of extremities or other parts of the body that causes muscle swelling or trauma, with or without neurological or orthopedic problems in the body parts. Body areas most commonly involved are the limbs and torso. • Crush syndrome develops when crush injury is extensive and prolonged, causing systemic manifestations. These systemic effects are due to traumatic rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) and reperfusion syn­ drome (release of potentially toxic muscle cell components and electrolytes into the circulatory system) after sudden release of pressure over the crushed limb or torso. Acute hypovolemia and metabolic abnor­ malities are common and can be severe (even fatal), and myoglobinuria from trauma to muscles frequently may cause or exacerbate renal failure if untreated. • Crush injuries and crush syndrome in MWDs are expected after building collapses, most frequently after natural disasters or explosions. In humans, the incidence of crush syndrome is 2-15% with approximately 50% of those with crush syndrome developing acute renal failure. Of those with renal failure, 50% need dialysis. Crush syndrome is rarely reported in animals.7,8 Pathophysiology • Crush injury develops after muscle injury and muscle cell death. Three mechanisms are responsible for the death of muscle cells, to include direct cell lysis by the force of the crush; direct pressure on muscle cells causing muscle ischemia, development of anaerobic metabolism and lactic acidosis, and cell membrane disruption and leakage; and vascular compression or disruption, with loss of blood supply to muscle tissue. • These mechanisms cause the injured muscle tissue to generate and release a number of substances that may be toxic in the general circulation. The crushing force actually serves as a protective mechanism, pre­ venting these toxins from reaching the central circulation. Once the patient is extricated and the force is Crush Injuries 70",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non-Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 6: Command Consultation 6 UNIT CONSULT: PROVIDE PREVENTION/MITIGATION ACTIVITIES FOR UNIT AS REQUESTED OR INDICATED Monitor, Detect, and Assess Monitor the Health and Well-Being of the Unit and Detect Concerning Issues Just as command and NSMP work jointly to monitor the behavioral health status of individual service members, they also monitor the unit as a whole, being familiar with baseline conditions and watchful for any changes. Information may be obtained from general observations, casual conversations, active questioning, concerning reports received from service members or chain of command, excessive sick call behaviors or misconduct, or other changes in cohesion, morale, behavior, or performance within the unit. When operational and/or combat stressors are evident, the NSMP and command should proactively ask questions and investigate how unit members are faring. Determine Best Way to Further Assess or Address a Concerning Situation Upon detecting unit concerns, command or the NSMP can request unit consultation and intervention and will meet to discuss the concerns and brainstorm the best path forward. The need for the consult may be obvious, for example, if the unit has endured harsh environmental conditions and their morale and performance are flagging. In this case, the NSMP may recommend and conduct an appropriate unit health promotion intervention or training. However, if the reasons for poor unit morale or performance are not fully known, the NSMP must assess the situation. Throughout the unit consultation process, the NSMP should identify who in the unit is at risk – if the entire unit was affected by a unit-wide stressor or if certain parts of the unit were more affected by a particular stressor. For example, if a service member attempts suicide and is medically evacuated, his/her platoon members will be most affected, while the battalion as a whole may be affected but to a lesser degree. These two populations may merit different assessment and intervention approaches. Assess Unit Morale, Climate, and Performance The NSMP and command should be continuously communicating and should collaborate on assessment plans and possible interventions. NSMP and command should determine if the concerns involve 1) the whole unit, 2) groups who have experienced an event and are at risk, or 3) individuals who are identified with an issue. Assessment and intervention plans should be tailored to the concerning issues and target population. The NSMP may utilize all sources of relevant information and employ methods that are less formal and rigorous (e.g., spot checks, interviewing key personnel) or more rigorous (unit survey). Some assessment options include: Review Available Data ➢ Analyze behavioral trends such as high rates of behavioral health referrals, sick call, misconduct, service member suicide, sexual assault, fratricide, or disciplinary actions. ➢ Review policy documents, such as standard operating procedures.

    "text": "      CHAPTER 13 Long Bone Fractures General Considerations • Recognize and manage life-threatening problems FIRST. Fractures and muscle, tendon, or ligament injuries are rarely life threatening. Resuscitate and stabilize life-threatening problems first. Provide treatment to prevent further compromise to the fracture site and neurovascular structures and minimize infection risk. • Recognize long bone fractures. MWDs with fractures will have varying degrees of lameness and will likely have limb deformity, swelling, pain, and loss of function. Open fractures are generally obvious, but pose greater risk of local and systemic infection and loss of function. See Management of Open Fractures in this chapter for specific guidance. • Provide analgesia and confine the MWD. Any MWD with possible fractures or joint injury should initially be given parenteral analgesia, continued orally once stabilized (See Chapter 16). Any MWD with possible fractures should be confined to its kennel or small space at all times, with limited opportunities to go outside to urinate and defecate (three times daily as a minimum). Use a make-shift sling placed under the abdomen while walking patients outside. Analgesia and confinement may be the only treatment necessary or feasible, as noted below. Long Bone Fractures and Joint Abnormalities of the Lower Limbs HCPs should stabilize any suspected fracture or joint abnormality of the long bones distal to the elbow and knee (radius/ulna, tibia/fibula). • Manage wounds as per Chapter 14 and then apply splints (e.g., SAM splints) to immobilize the fracture site, ensuring the joints above and below the fracture site are immobilized. Apply buttresses made of layers of cast padding or non-adherent dressing around footpads and any wounds. Apply about twice as much cast padding as is used for people. Generally, it is best to leave the nails of the middle two toes exposed, to allow monitoring for swelling. • Cast application is not recommended, as cast pressure or friction sores are extremely common with MWDs and complicate recovery. MWDs tolerate splints and bandages poorly, so any MWD with a bandage or splint applied must wear a device to prevent self-mutilation or bandage removal (See Figure 21 and Figure 22). • Splints and bandages generally need to be changed at least every other day. Change more frequently if soiled, wet, or loose. Long Bone Fractures 73",

Address pain with appropriate analgesic therapy (See Chapter 16). Reassess pain every 4-6 hours. • Manage soft tissue injuries over the fracture site appropriately, as proper management of the wound postures the patient for successful outcome. See Chapter 14 for wound management recommendations. • After appropriate wound care, apply a sterile moisture-retentive bandage over open fractures, as it is important to keep soft tissues and bone moist for optimal healing. Change bandages at least once daily, based on degree of strike-through, soiling, or loosening. TABLE 17. MANAGEMENT OF LONG BONE FRACTU RES IN MWDS1 ,2 1. Address life-threatening problems first! During resuscitation, protect any open fractures. • Do not attempt to reduce bones protruding at the fracture site. • Remove any large gross contaminants from the wound, such as leaves, rocks, or stick fragments, but do not clip hair or cleanse the wound at this point. • Cover the fracture and wound with sterile non-adherent dressing and apply a light protective bandage. 2. LOWER LIMB FRACTURES -- After resuscitation, immobilize fractures or joint abnormalities involving the limbs below the elbow or knee, prevent bacterial infection, provide analgesia, and promote normal healing until definitive surgical repair. • Culture any open fracture sites as soon as possible, and before antibiotic use if possible. • Administer antibiotics as directed in Chapter 14 for open fractures. • Manage any open wounds over the fracture site as per Chapter 14. • Provide analgesia as directed in Chapter 16. Reassess pain every 4-6 hours. • Apply splints or heavy bandages to immobilize the fracture site, ensuring the joints above and below the fracture site are immobilized. 3. UPPER LIMB FRACTURES – After resuscitation, minimize further injury to fractures of the limbs above the elbow or knee. • Culture any open fracture sites as soon as possible, and before antibiotic use if possible. • Administer antibiotics as directed in Chapter 14 for open fractures. • Manage any open wounds over the fracture site as per Chapter 14. • Provide analgesia as directed in Chapter 16. Reassess pain every 4-6 hours. • Unless experienced in external coaptation, DO NOT apply splints or heavy bandages, as these are poorly tolerated by MWDs and will increase the risk of displacement and further injury to the neurovascular bundle. • Confine the MWD to a kennel or small space; limit walks; and support as needed when walked. 4. Monitor MWDs with fractures. • Ensure a device is used to prevent self-trauma (See Chapter 2). • Assess pain frequently and ensure adequate analgesia. • Change splints or bandages daily (open fractures, wounds, soiled or wet) or every other day (clean and dry splints or bandages that do not cover open fractures or wounds).

Iohexol is most commonly used in MWDs. For a vial of iohexol at a concentration of 240mg/mL, the intravenous contrast dose is 400 mg/kg (rule of thumb is 1 mL of contrast agent per pound of body weight, not to exceed 60 mL). • IV catheterization of the patient is required for contrast administration, and the contrast is a thick, sticky solution which needs to be bolused to the patient, so use 18 gauge catheters and syringe needles. • After bolusing the contrast to the patient, only the study in the standard algorithm needs to be repeated. • If the patient is dehydrated, the patient should be rehydrated prior to the CT study if possible or at least on IV fluids to correct the problem if unavoidable. • Adverse side effects are rare with non-ionic contrast media in correctly hydrated patients. CT Protocols CT protocols will vary per region you are attempting to image, patient positioning, slice thickness, algorithms, and whether or not contrast will be used. Each of these factors is critical, but the most commonly overlooked factor is patient positioning. Ensure the region of the patient you are imaging is straight and symmetrically positioned on midline of the CT table, as subtle changes in obliquity may make structures appear abnormal when they are not. Use positional aids, sponges, or troughs if needed, and ensure that all metallic or other unnecessary objects are removed. Place the patient either head-first or hindlimb-first into the gantry, depend­ ing on which will be closest to the region for imaging. The following are recommended protocols for different body regions based on common problems seen in MWDs. CT Skull Patient positioning should be in ventral recumbency, with the hard palate parallel to the CT table. Studies should extend from the tip of the nose to the 2nd to 3rd cervical vertebra. Bone, standard, and bone algo­ rithms with slice thicknesses of 2.5 mm, 1.25 mm, and 0.625 (if available) should be performed, respectively. Sagittal and dorsal reconstructions should be made as needed. CT Nasal Patient positioning should be in ventral recumbency, with the hard palate parallel to the CT table. Studies should extend from the tip of the nose to the larynx. A bone algorithm with slice thicknesses of 2.5 mm and 0.625 mm (or equivalent) and a standard algorithm with slice thickness of 1.25 mm should be performed. Intravenous contrast should be administered, and the standard algorithm with 1.25 mm thick slices repeated. Dorsal reconstructions are required. Sagittal reconstructions should be made as needed.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel unable to sleep for a sufficient amount to meet their needs (known colloquially as insomnia). Management strategies for poor sleep ability differ from those for poor sleep opportunity. When a provider identifies the presence of insufficient sleep time, despite adequate opportunity, apply evidence‐based strategies for insomnia (e.g., cognitive‐behavioral therapy). • Recognition of sleep as only “cure” for sleep loss: Given the cognitive impairments of sleep deprivation, as well as amount of time required and environmental and circadian considerations for adequate sleep, service members may attempt to abate the need for sleep with substances or behaviors. For example, use of caffeine and nicotine, standing, loud noise, or use of cold air are used to promote wakefulness. However, research has conclusively demonstrated that there is no replacement for sleep.7 The brain has a physiological need for sleep to maintain function. If sleep is not obtained, the brain will eventually lapse into sleep without voluntary intent. No treatment for sleep deprivation, other than getting sleep should be recommended. After periods of sleep deprivation, up to 14 hours of recovery sleep may be necessitated to restore the body.6 Providers should discourage sleep deprivation, to the extent possible, and recognize that sleep management in other than “best” conditions should be considered temporary and may result in adverse outcomes for the individual and the unit. MINIMUM, BETTER, AND BEST INTERVENTIONS MINIMUM Self Care and Rest and Restoration During short term periods of sleep restriction below six hours, sustain performance with napping and appropriate caffeine dosing. Under unavoidable conditions of reduced nighttime sleep with six hours or less time in bed due to operational demand, the primary management approach should be adjunctive napping when feasible.7 Due to the afternoon “dip” in alertness described above, afternoons represent an optimal time to nap without dampening nighttime sleep. Napping prior to shift work may also be beneficial. Under a predictable schedule, short, infrequent naps may be sufficient. When the next available sleep opportunity is unpredictable, a nap of a long a duration, if feasible, may be warranted. Additionally, judicious use of caffeine may help maintain alertness, but will not impact cognitive function. However, caffeine should be avoided on a regular basis due to rapid tolerance.9 The optimal dose is 200 mg per use, once upon awakening and again four hours later.7 The last dose should not occur within six hours of the subsequent sleep period. Note that these recommendations do not apply to voluntary restriction of sleep time despite adequate time off duty to obtain more sleep. In these cases, assuming no impairment in sleep ability, providers should recommend the development of a sleep schedule allowing for eight or more hours of sleep. BETTER Self Care and Psychoeducation and Sleep Hygiene Eight non‐consecutive hours of sleep per 24‐hour period OR eight consecutive hours in a minimally adequate environment or during daytime is recommended. Under operational conditions where periods of continuous sleep are not available, but sufficient down time exists for multiple, shorter periods of sleep, providers should facilitate service members’ planning for eight total hours of sleep per 24‐hour period in as long a blocks of time as is possible. The human sleep period is composed of a series of cycles through varying stages of sleep intended to flow continuously until complete after four to five cycles. Interrupted sleep and shorter periods of sleep prevent persons from obtaining full amounts of deep, restorative sleep, as well as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, a stage that contributes to learning and memory processing. Since each cycle takes approximately 90‐120 minutes, four two‐hour blocks of sleep or two four‐ hour blocks of sleep are preferable to a series of one‐hour naps or sleep chunks of varying durations. Because sleep is not continuous, even if the total duration reaches eight hours, anticipate that performance and alertness will be suboptimal and consider recommendations to duty type and capacity accordingly. Alternatively, in conditions in which periods of eight or more continuous hours of sleep are feasible, but the sleep environment is not fully adequate (e.g., loud, lighted, or uncomfortable/disturbed sleep circumstances), similarly expect that performance and alertness will be Chapter 4: Management of Most Common Behavioral Health Conditions That May Manifest in Forward Environments 3",

Lavage of the wound is necessary to remove particulate debris and reduce bacterial contamination – remember the adage, “The solution to pollution is dilution.” • There are several devices acceptable and available for adjunctive wound irrigation. Simple bulb irriga­ tion and gravity irrigation have been the preferred method of wound irrigation. The bulb and syringe method has been more widely accepted and is significantly less expensive. Large bore gravity-run tub­ ing has been favored for quick irrigations. Pulsatile jet lavage irrigation using a battery powered system is another method of adjunctive irrigation in the overall management of contaminated crushed wounds. It must be emphasized that all methods of wound irrigation, including pulsatile lavage, are ad­ juncts to sharp, surgical debridement and not a substitute for surgical debridement. • Normal saline, sterile water and potable tap water all have documented similar usefulness, efficacy and safety. Sterile isotonic solutions are readily available and remain the fluid of choice for irrigation. If un­ available, sterile water or potable tap water can be used. • Bacterial loads drop logarithmically with increasing volumes of 1, 3, 6, and 9 liters of irrigation. The current recommendations are as follows: 1-3 liters for small volume wounds, 4-8 liters for moderate wounds, and 9 or more liters for large wounds or wounds with evidence of heavy contamination.3 4. Generally, contaminated and dirty/infected wounds should not be sutured until healthy granulation tissue is established, which generally occurs in 3-5 days. This is especially true for bite wounds. Bandaging Recommendations • In nearly all cases, open wounds should be bandaged to protect the wound from contamination and support the wound while it heals. In most cases, mechanical debridement is desired (i.e., in most wounds after initial management has been performed, with varying degrees of contamination or infection), so use an adherent dressing. Once a healthy granulation bed has formed, convert to a non-adherent dressing. • The most common adherent dressing is a wet-to-dry bandage, consisting of sterile gauze sponges that are saturated with sterile saline, gently wrung to eliminate excessive moisture, and the applied directly to the wound. Over the wet dressing, several dry gauze sponges are applied. In large wounds, laparotomy spong­ es may be optimal to cover more wound bed. • The most common non-adherent dressing is a semi-occlusive cotton pad (e.g., Telfa®) that retains moisture against the wound bed and ‘wicks‘ exudate from the surface of the wound. • Use topical silver sulfadiazine ointment or triple-antibiotic ointment on most wounds. • Apply a secondary layer over the primary layer. Most commonly, rolled cast padding or roll cotton is used to provide support. Splints can be included in the secondary layer, if used. Wound Management 78",

Figure 29 shows anatomic location for needle thoracocentesis in dogs, with the dog in lateral or sternal re­ cumbency, and the needle inserted generally on the mid-lateral thorax between the 6th to 8th intercostal space. Count forward from the last rib (#13; red dotted line) to find the insertion site. Immediate placement of a thoracostomy tube is indicated if negative pressure cannot be achieved with needle thoracocentesis, if large amounts of blood are aspirated, or if repeated thoracocenteses are re­ quired to maintain negative pleural pressure. • A general rule of thumb for thoracostomy tube sizes is the chest tube should be the largest size that com­ fortably fits in the intercostal space. For most MWDs, use fenestrated tubes that are 24-36 Fr. Figure 30 shows the correct anatomic orientation for chest tubes placed in dogs. Table 9 describes techniques for chest tube placement in MWDs. • Tube thoracostomy is a painful procedure. In emergent or critically ill patients, local analgesia may not be necessary. Consider local anesthesia, intercostal nerve blocks, and intrapleural analgesia in all other pa­ tients (See Chapter 16). • Remove chest tubes when air or fluid accumulation is less than 2-4 mL/kg body weight per day. • The chest tube will ideally lie in the pleural space, generally oriented cranioventrally to maximize removal of air and fluid. It is best to pre-measure the tube visually before placement to ensure proper depth of insertion. Be certain the last fenestration of the tube will be within the chest cavity. • Patients with chest tubes in place MUST be monitored continuously! • Some form of removal of air or fluid must be used. This can be continuous suction or intermittent as­ piration by personnel. Needle Thoracocentesis & Tube Thoracostomy 21",

Note that radiographic signs (mixed interstitial-alveolar pattern) may lag 12-24 hours, and the stress of the process is usually not warranted. • Hemoptysis, especially of arterialized (bright red) blood suggests significant large pulmonary vessel trauma that typically carries a very guarded prognosis. • Most MWDs with pulmonary contusions do not require mechanical ventilation. Management of pulmo­ nary contusions involves minimizing stress, providing oxygen supplementation, cautious intravenous fluid administration to prevent progression of contusions and/or development of pulmonary edema, and possi­ ble addition of colloids to the fluid therapy plan to decrease the amount of lung water that may accumu­ late during shock resuscitation. Diuretics and steroids are not indicated in treatment of pulmonary contu­ sions, and may increase patient morbidity and mortality. • Severe, life-threatening major pulmonary vessel hemorrhage may require resuscitative thoracotomy. Refer to the discussion of Resuscitative Thoracotomy in this chapter for guidance and technique. Diaphragmatic Hernia Auscultation of borborygma over the area of the lung field suggests the presence of a diaphragmatic hernia, but can be misleading. Standard radiography and ultrasonography procedures are diagnostic. Assume a her­ nia is present, and carefully manage the patient to minimize discomfort and further organ herniation until the patient is stable enough to allow definitive diagnosis of the hernia. • Diaphragmatic hernia (DH) is usually not considered a surgical emergency unless the stomach is in­ volved, or the patient’s condition deteriorates or fails to respond to conservative management. In most cases, the patient should be stabilized for shock and other organ injury, with definitive repair of the her­ nia at a later time. Most patients suffering trauma severe enough to rupture the diaphragm have other pulmonary injuries that would preclude anesthesia and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) (e.g., contusions, pneumothorax). • Emergent repair of a DH may be indicated. Repair is performed via a cranial ventral midline laparotomy, with retraction of the liver and stomach caudally, to afford optimal visualization. • Some means of positive pressure ventilation is necessary intraoperatively. • At least 1 thoracostomy tube should be placed intraoperatively and maintained for at least 24 hours post-operatively to manage pneumothorax. • Generally, rents in the diaphragm due to trauma occur in the muscular portions of the diaphragm, and are readily repaired using a simple continuous suture closure.

    "text": "   Rule Out Problems Mimicking C-PTSD Some medical problems cause signs that mimic C-PTSD. HCPs should carefully evaluate dogs for exclusionary criteria, such as traumatic brain injury (See Chapter 17). A key tip-off that C-PTSD is likely not present is devel­ opment of behavioral signs before the antecedent events noted previously. Veterinary personnel must rule out anecdotal reports and other appropriate behavioral diagnoses in order to validate a C-PTSD diagnosis. Management Guidance for HCPS Listen to the MWD handler! If a handler seeks guidance for his or her working dog due to abnormal behavior in the first 30 days after a traumatic event or combat action, HCPs should do the following: 1. Record the interaction and forward to supporting veterinary personnel (See Chapter 22). 2. Direct the handler immediately remove the dog from the situation, if not already done. 3. Upon approval from the supporting veterinary officer, provide an anxiolytic for dogs that have demon­ strated a moderate-to-severe response, using one of the following agents, given PO (preferable), IV, or IM: • Clorazepate (TRANXENE®), 12.5 mg per dog PO q12h (moderate response) • Buspirone (BUSPAR®), 10-20 mg per dog PO q8-12h (moderate to severe response) • Alprazolam (XANAX®), 1-2 mg per dog PO q12h (moderate to severe response) 4. Direct the handler to provide support for the dog with social activity and play. 5. Direct the handler to provide work therapy by performing critical tasks in safe area, free from distress. 6. Recommend to the handler and the commander that the MWD not be used in the tactical environment until the dog has been evaluated by veterinary personnel. 7. Coordinate soonest evacuation to veterinary personnel for further evaluation and care, base on the tacti­ cal situation and resource availability. MWDs with C-PTSD should be classified as ROUTINE for evacuation planning purposes. Long-term Management There is no role for HCPs to attempt long-term or delayed management of presumed C-PTSD. Misdiagnosis and/or delay of appropriate treatment will equally jeopardize the affected MWD’s proper therapy and poten­ tial of return to duty. Affected dogs should be evaluated under the supervision of Veterinary Corps Officers and through consultation with the DODMWDVS board-certified animal behaviorist. On-going research sug­ gests a positive association with early diagnosis, +/- medication and focused desensitization/ counterconditioning performed by the MWD handler in the first 60-90 days of case management. Every attempt is made to return the MWD to duty and avoid unnecessary STRATEVAC/redeployment, which can re­ sult in security and readiness issues. C-PTSD 98",

More likely associated with diving than altitude exposure. Treatment • If DCS occurs while in flight descend to a lower altitude or to the ground level • Place patient on 100% O2 (for denitrogenating) • Monitor vital signs and conduct a Neuro exam. Note any changes. • Minimize any reactor movement. • Start IV. 250ml/hr NS or LR. • Definitive treatment is to bring patient to a HYPERBARIC chamber. o Contact a flight surgeon for coordination. o Bring patient to closes Hyperbaric chamber with a low flight profile. Notes, Warnings, Cautions • Onset can occur as long as 48 hours after exposure to altitudes above 18,000 ft. • De-nitrogenation (Nitrogen concentration is reduced by breathing 100% O2. This allows no new nitrogen into the body while existing nitrogen is removed from the lungs eliminating much of the nitrogen dissolved in body tissues.) • All Types of DCS should be treated as an emergency.",

    "text": "RETURN TO DUTY CONSIDERATIONS: Question: What is the Borg scale and how does it compare to heart rate monitoring during exercise? Answer: The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale helps estimate how hard someone is working (activity intensity). The Borg RPE can be multiplied by 10 to get a fairly good estimate of the individual’s actual heart rate.1 For example, if the SM is on a treadmill and reports a 13 (Somewhat hard, but it still feels OK to continue), their estimated heart rate would be 13 x 10 = 130 bpm. Because this is only an approximation of heart rate, the actual heart rate can vary depending on age and physical condition. Question: Why is the ANAM part of the RTD screening? What if the ANAM is not available in my setting? Answer: Growing evidence supports the importance of both cognitive and physical readiness for return to duty. The ANAM is a neurocognitive assessment tool that has been normed and validated in military SMs. Additionally, many SMs have a baseline ANAM score from before their concussion, which allows for comparison. Thus, the ANAM provides the best evaluation of a SM’s cognitive function in relation to their peers and their own pre-concussion performance. If the ANAM is not available, you can either refer to a nearby MTF that has ANAM testing or repeat the cognitive exam portion of the MACE 2. Question: I’m deployed, and we need the SM back to duty before they have completed the full PRA for mission readiness. What should I do? Answer: This clinical recommendation is intended to serve as a guideline, and while strongly encouraged to promote a safe recovery for concussed SMs, these recommendations may be superseded at medical or command discretion. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS: Question: Why should we avoid using tramadol, acetaminophen/caffeine/butalbital, and opioids in the acute stages of concussion? Answer: All of these medications can cause CNS depression and alter cognitive function, which can mimic other conditions associated with traumatic brain injury (e.g. intracranial bleed) and obscure the clinical course of TBI. The sedating effects of these medications can also be intensified in patients with head injury.2 In addition, all of these medications carry high risk of dependence, tolerance, and medication overuse (rebound) headaches. Lastly, tramadol and opioids can cause nausea and vomiting, and tramadol may increase the risk of seizures. Question: Why should we wait 48 hours before using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treatment of post- traumatic headache? Answer: Use of NSAIDs for post-traumatic headache should be delayed for 48 hours following concussion due to their anti-platelet effect and the potential risk of exacerbating an evolving intracranial bleed. Question: Why should SMs minimize consumption of caffeine/energy drinks and nicotine and avoid alcohol after a concussion? Answer: There is limited evidence on the impact of caffeine, energy drinks, nicotine, and alcohol on concussion recovery. However, these substances can cause dehydration, disrupt sleep patterns, and worsen post-concussion symptoms resulting in a delay in return to duty. Abrupt cessation of caffeine or nicotine may result in withdrawal symptoms, therefore, we recommend SMs minimize or maintain their pre-injury levels of these substances. We recommend abstinence from alcohol as any use may exacerbate concussion symptoms including headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, cognitive disturbances, depression and anxiety. Additionally, excessive alcohol use may increase fall risk, which places a SM at higher risk for a 2nd concussion. Question: My patient is not progressing or is progressing very slowly. What are the risk factors for protracted recovery? Answer: There are several risk factors, both pre- and post-traumatic, associated with protracted recovery following concussion. The most consistent predictor of delayed recovery is the severity of acute and subacute symptoms.3 Pre- traumatic factors include female sex, history of concussion, migraine headaches, sleep disorders, and psychological conditions (including PTSD, anxiety, depression, ADHD, and substance abuse).4,5,6 Post-traumatic factors include post- traumatic migraine/headache and acute dizziness.3,4 Particularly relevant in the military population is the prevalence of PTSD and its potential impact on concussion recovery. The risk for PTSD is elevated two-to-three fold following concussion, and the prevalence of co-morbid PTSD and TBI has been reported to range from 10-40%.7,8 During early concussion care, providers should be aware of risk factors for PTSD, including acute stress disorder (ASD), which is diagnosed when acute stress reaction (ASR) or combat or operational stress reaction (COSR) persists beyond three days. Refer to the VA/DoD PTSD and ASD Clinical Practice Guideline for more information on ASR, ASD, and PTSD. Question: When is it safe for a SM to have sexual intercourse following a concussion? Answer: Sexual activity can be slowly reintroduced, as with other strenuous activity, during progression through the stages. It is safe to have sex when the SM is able to do so without exacerbating symptoms. Consider fatigue, mood, and dizziness in addition to other physical symptoms. During recovery, SMs may wish to modify sexual activity (e.g. position, frequency, intensity) in order to minimize symptoms.

Figure 30 shows correct placement of a chest tube on the lateral aspect of the chest in a dog, with the tube penetrating the skin at the 9th to 11th intercostal space (ICS), tunneling cranioventrally to penetrate the chest wall at the 7th to 8th ICS, directed toward the olecranon of the elbow. Photo courtesy of Dr. Tim Hackett. Resuscitative Thoracotomy • Emergent thoracotomy may be indicated, keeping in mind caveats discussed previously. • Thoracotomy in dogs is generally best done through a LEFT lateral thoracic wall approach, generally at the 4th to 5th or 5th to 6th intercostal space to afford optimal visualization. A median approach is not recommended in MWDs, given difficulties in post-operative management. • Euthanasia should be considered for a MWD for which a resuscitative thoracotomy is deemed necessary but cannot be performed or has proven unsuccessful (See Chapter 21). Parenchymal Trauma Pulmonary contusions and intrabronchial hemorrhage are common. A restrictive breathing pattern may be noted in patients with mild and moderate parenchymal injury. Patients with severe parenchymal injury often have a parenchymal pattern, seen as respiratory distress with labored inspiration and expiration, with or without hemoptysis. • Auscult the chest for decreased lung sounds, which suggest either fluid (blood) or air in the pleural space, or pulmonary contusions. A patchy distribution of altered lung sounds may be noted, which helps differ­ entiate parenchymal injury from pleural space trauma. Thoracic Injury 22",

    "text": "   CHAPTER 5 Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Indications for CPR HCPs should consider CPR of MWDs in cases of non-traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest (anesthesia-related, hypothermia, near drowning, electrocution). If the tactical situation and resources permit, HCPs may consider CPR in MWDs with CPA due to blast injury, blunt trauma, or penetrating trauma, although successful resusci­ tation in these cases is unlikely. Overall survival in dogs is approximately 5%. Clinical Management Algorithm for CPR In general, CPR is performed in much the same manner as for people.1 Management guidelines for CPR in dogs are provided (See Figure 31 and Table 10). Basic Life Support2-4 2-person, closed-chest CPR should be initiated as soon as CPA is declared. • Circulation – Immediately begin sustained, forceful chest compressions with the MWD in lateral recum­ bency (on either side) at a rate of 100 compressions per minute. Sustain compressions for at least 2-3 minutes per cycle. Hand placement can be directly over the heart (where the elbow crosses the chest above the sternum when the forearm is pulled caudally) or over the widest part of the chest (See Figure 32). Ensure adequate relief of downward pressure during the relaxation phase of the compressions. As for people, “PUSH HARD and PUSH FAST.”1 • Airway – Establish an airway as rap- Figure 31.

Clip hair and surgically prepare a 6 inch X 6 inch area of the ventral neck area just distal to the larynx. 2. For conscious MWDs, sedate and use 20 mg lidocaine locally. 3. Attach a 10 mL syringe to the hub of a 14 or 16 gauge, 6 inch, over-the-needle catheter. 4. Stabilize the trachea with one hand. 5. While holding the catheter-syringe apparatus at a 45° angle, direct the catheter through the skin and annular ring between the 3rd and 4th or 4th and 5th tracheal cartilages, directed ventrally down the trachea. Do not pass through the cricothyroid membrane in dogs. 6. Begin to slowly aspirate with the syringe as you pass the catheter through skin. 7. Once the tip of the needle is through the skin, aspiration of air signifies successful entry into the tra­ cheal lumen. 8. Once the catheter is successfully introduced into the tracheal lumen, stabilize the needle to prevent any further advancement of the needle into the trachea. 9. Advance the catheter OFF the needle, directed down the trachea, until the hub of the catheter is in contact with the skin. 10. Remove the needle from the catheter. 11. Attach oxygen tubing to hub of catheter and provide high-flow oxygen (10-15 L/min). 12. Do not use this method for more than 30-45 minutes, as hypercapnia will develop and lung barotrau­ ma may occur due to high airway pressures.

Collect samples for microbial culture and sensitivity testing, preferably before antibiotic therapy is started. Transfer samples to supporting veterinary personnel for submission. b. Initiate antibiotic therapy within the first 6 hours of the wound‘s development, or as soon as possible thereafter (See Table 19 on next page for antibiotic selection and dosing). c. Culture the wound if obvious infection develops during any phase of wound management, if the wound fails to heal normally, or if systemic signs of infection develop. 2. Provide initial wound management. a. Provide effective analgesia or anesthesia based on wound severity, location, and other factors (See Chapter 16). b. Apply sterile water-soluble lubricant to the wound bed and then clip the hair generously around the wound. c. Gently cleanse the skin around the wound, but not the wound bed, with surgical scrub. d. Gently lavage the lubricant and gross contaminants from the wound using sterile saline or lactated Ringer‘s solution (LRS). e. Debride grossly necrotic tissues and non-viable tissue carefully using aseptic technique and sharp dis­ section. 1) Do not mass ligate tissues or use cautery excessively. 2) Do not damage, transect, or ligate major blood vessels (unless actively hemorrhaging) or nerves, as these are crucial to maintain effective blood flow and innervation distally. f. Lavage the wound to remove particulate debris and reduce bacterial contamination. 1) Thoroughly lavage the wound bed. 2) Lavage under pressure. 3) Sterile isotonic solutions are the fluid of choice. g. Bandage the wound. 1) Apply a primary layer to provide mechanical debridement initially, using a wet-to-dry bandage, con­ sisting of sterile gauze sponges saturated with sterile saline, gently wrung to eliminate excessive moisture, and applied directly to the wound. 2) Apply several dry gauze sponges over the primary layer. 3) Apply a secondary layer over the primary layer, using cast padding or roll cotton +/- splints to pro­ vide support. 4) Apply a tertiary layer of non-adherent conforming bandage, adhesive bandage, or both, using light compression. 5) Apply a “tie-over” bandage in areas that are not amenable to routine bandaging. 3. Provide daily wound care until evacuation, using appropriate analgesia, sedation, or anesthesia. Change bandages at least once daily, but more frequently if heavy discharge is present or the bandage is soiled or partially removed by the patient. Lavage the wound as above at every bandage change. Debride the wound as above at every bandage change. Apply a new bandage as above; however, change the prima­ ry layer to a non-adherent dressing once a healthy granulation bed is formed.

    "text": "       Long Bone Fractures and Joint Abnormalities of the Upper Limbs In MWDs, fractures of these bones are very difficult to immobilize, splints and bandages are poorly tolerated, and splints and bandages can actually increase fracture displacement, worsen fractures, and jeopardize neuro­ vascular bundles. Key management principles are to provide adequate analgesia (See Chapter 16) and mini­ mize movement to the maximal extent (kennel confinement except for limited leashed walks, using ancillary support). • HCPs without advanced orthopedic training and experience generally should not attempt to immobilize fractures of the humerus, scapula, or femur.1,2 • HCPs with advanced training and experience in orthopedics (typically orthopedic surgeons, orthopedic PAs, splint technicians in Level 2 or higher facilities) may be capable, with written and/or verbal guidance from supporting veterinarians in constructing an appropriate Spica splint for humerus and femur fractures. In these instances, appropriate coaptation is safe, makes the patient more comfortable and consequently makes it easier and safer to transport a wounded MWD. With appropriate coaptation, the MWD is less likely to become agitated or aggressive every time it is bumped, moved, or moves about during manipula­ tion and transport. Open Fractures Proper management of open fractures is essential. Open fractures should be treated as a medical emergency, once more pressing problems are addressed (See Table 17).1,2 Initial management of open fractures during resuscitation. While evaluating the entire patient and initiating life-saving therapy, take measures to protect the open fracture site: • Do not attempt to reduce bone(s) protruding at fracture sites, as this drags contamination to the fracture site and may cause injury to the neurovascular bundle. • Quickly remove any large gross contaminants from the wound (e.g., leaves, rocks, stick fragments), but do not attempt to clip the hair or cleanse the wound at this point. • Cover the fracture and wound with sterile non-adherent dressing and apply a light bandage. This bandage should not be placed in an attempt to stabilize or immobilize the fracture at this time; it is simply to pro­ tect the open wounds and exposed bone from further contamination during initial patient resuscitation. Specific management recommendations for open fractures. MWDs with open fractures generally will require surgical correction of the fracture once evacuated to veterinary facilities. The overriding aims are to prevent bacterial infection and promote normal healing. • Culture open fracture sites as soon as possible after presentation and before antibiotic use if possible. • Administer antibiotics as per Table 19 in Chapter 14, focusing on use of intravenous antibiotics based on (Continued on page 93) Long Bone Fractures 74",

    "text": "      Traumatic Brain Injury There is limited data on TBI in animals. Anticipate TBI in MWDs after trauma in 25-40% of cases. 2-6 TBI carries an extremely high mortality; assume a prehospital mortality of >40% in severe TBI cases. Management of MWDs is largely based on recommendations for treating people. Care by HCPs should be directed at efforts to mitigate secondary injury from hypotension, hyperthermia, hyper- and hypoglycemia, hypoxia, hyper-and hy­ pocapnia, acid-base imbalances, electrolyte imbalances, SIRS, MODS, and ARDS. Thus, HCP care should be di­ rected at maintenance of blood pressure, normoxemia, normal ventilation, and normal body temperature. Clinical Signs Suggesting TBI Brain injury should be suspected in any trauma patient with altered mentation (coma, stupor, depression, lethargy, inappropriate behavior or responses) or with physical evidence of head trauma (e.g., lacerations, abrasions, bruising, swelling, pain, bleeding from the nose or ears). • Pay special attention to the patient‘s level of consciousness (LOC), overall pain response, pupillary light responses, cardiac and respiratory changes, motor activity and reflexes, and body temperature. • The external ear canals and nasal openings should be examined for evidence of blood or CSF. • The presence of lateralizing neurologic signs in a patient with brain injury suggests underlying intracranial hemorrhage; whereas patients with diffuse CNS deficits more probably have significant intracranial edema as a cause or contributor to their neurologic dysfunction.2-5 These findings will affect treatment options. • MWD posture on presentation may allow injury localization and estimation of prognosis. While these clas­ sic postures are not always noted, their presence can be used by first responders to identify severe TBI with poor-to-grave prognoses. • Patients with injury to the T2-L2 thoracic spine often display the Schiff-Sherrington syndrome (Figure 47, inset A), typically with normal mentation, forelimbs in extensor rigidity, and hind limbs that are flaccid. The prognosis for these patients is usually grave due to severe spinal cord trauma. • Patients with decerebellate rigidity (Figure 47, inset B) typically are obtunded or depressed, have Figure 47.

Most CPGs will not have a doctrine element. In this column place any doctrinal requirements for the CPG. What needs to be indoctrinated to use the CPG to improve the care of combat casualties. Organization – How teams/units are organized to achieve the mission. This is relevant given that some deployed medical teams will not be able to care for certain casualties, emphasizing the need for early transport. For example, if a team does not have a surgical capability, but the CPG mainly addresses/emphasizes surgical treatment. It is deﬁned as ‘how military units organize to ﬁght (e.g., divisions, air wings, Marine-Air Ground Task Forces). Combat casualty care (CCC) capabilities are organized by Role 1, 2, 3, 4. How does the CPG ﬁt into the deployed continuum of care? Is it a Role 2/3 CPG? What are the prehospital implications? Where on the CCC continuum does the CPG get implemented? For example, the Traumatic Brain Injury and Neurosurgery CPG is a Role 3 CPG, with some Role 2 and prehospital considerations. In this column place organizational requirement to execute the clinical care recommended in the CPG. Does there need to be an OR? A Blood Bank? See description. Training – Most CPGs will have training implications. They should be listed here. Not all training will be a requirement, but if there is required training for the clinical entity that the CPG is addressing, it should be explained. This can be used to drive pre-deployment training requirements. It is deﬁned as how units prepare to ﬁght tactically (from basic training to advanced individual training, unit training, joint exercises, etc.). If training exercises should include what is being addressed in the CPG, mention it here (the Walking Blood Bank (WBB) is another example). This should drive elements of a joint curriculum based on battleﬁeld care. In this column place the training implications and training requirements to execute the mission outlined in the CPG. Is the training just CPG training or are there requirements that should be executed in the MHS? Materiel – The JTS has a partnership with MEDLOG, who will assist with this section. MEDLOG is reviewing each CPG for the materiel requirements necessary to care for the patient addressed by the CPG. The lead author will get the list from MEDLOG and work with the CPG team and MEDLOG for updates. Most CPGs do have a materiel requirement (medications, devices, dressings, equipment, etc.). It is deﬁned as all the “stuﬀ” necessary to equip our forces (medical units/teams) that DOES NOT require a new development eﬀort (it is what is available “oﬀ the shelf” both commercially and within the government). This column could get unruly. In this column list the materiel requirements needed to execute the CPG. This will be mostly medication and stuﬀ. Leadership and Education – This is deﬁned as: “how we prepare our leaders to lead the ﬁght, from squad leader to 4-star general/admiral to professional development.” Most of the JTS CPGS have some sort of educational component that should be delineated here. This links closely to training but is diﬀerent. For example, the Emergency Life-Saving Cranial Procedures by Non-Neurosurgeons in the Deployed Setting CPG states that general surgeons should scrub on craniotomies prior to deploying if there is a possibility of performing this procedure at the Role 2. One of the leadership criteria is the Role 1-3 commanders should be familiar with the CPG so the unit can perform/manage the clinical entity the CPG is addressing. Another example is for the Dismounted Complex Blast Injury (DCBI) CPG. Leaders should be aware of this risk of DCBI and ensure teams are educated and trained on the unique aspects of management of these casualties and that there are always enough blood In this column put the leadership qualities and support that is needed to manage the type of patients being discussed in the CPG.",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non-Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 6: Command Consultation 7 increased irritability and problem behaviors. The Unit-IQ survey (Appendix H) categorizes broad areas of concern across the unit: trauma experiences, clinical conditions, sleep problems, family stressors, combat and operational stressors, unit aggression/problem behaviors, decreased unit cohesion/morale/performance, and toxic leadership concerns. Administering unit surveys to assess concerns can act as an intervention in and of itself, because it demonstrates that 1) the problem is noticed, and 2) someone is willing to do something about it. The Unit-IQ serves as a flexible resource designed to cover a wide range of issues in a brief format, but it does not need to be administered in its entirety; NSMPs may choose to include only certain selected items relevant to their immediate concerns. Additionally, the Unit-IQ is split into three sections, so that NSMPs may administer clusters of related questions to understand a particular concern. These three sections include 1) Behavioral Health and Sleep Indicators, 2) Combat and Operational Stressors, and 3) Unit Climate and Leadership Concerns. The survey should be both anonymous and voluntary. The NSMP may announce the survey request at formation or at the DFAC, and arrange a secure pick up and drop off point. However, it is important to ensure that an adequate and representative number of the target population of service members are surveyed; otherwise, survey results may be misleading. Reviewing the demographic information on the Unit-IQ will shed light on the nature of the sample in terms of rank and MOS. When the NSMP has received all completed surveys, they should calculate the results, form opinions, and may follow up with voluntary “walkabout” interviews, paying special attention to rounding out the sample to ensure its representativeness. For additional information or guidance, the NSMP may consult with the tele-behavioral health NSMP and/or chaplain as needed. ANALYZE POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS AND DEVELOP ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COMMAND If the NSMP suspects that toxic leadership may play a role in unit morale and performance, the NSMP should follow steps in the Command Monitoring section (below). Otherwise, the NSMP verbally briefs command on their assessment of the unit issue and their recommendations for intervention. In broad strokes, recommendations may include 1) practical actions that command can take to address the situation, 2) unit health promotion interventions and trainings, including Traumatic Event Management (TEM) if indicated, and 3) command after action reviews. Command can implement a wide-ranging number and type of actions, e.g., altering planned mission rest times, taking actions to mitigate environmental concerns, imposing curfew, limiting electronics use, conducting unit assessments (UAs), increasing monitoring, establishing zero tolerance policy, affirming an open-door policy, and so on. As indicated, command will conduct after action reviews following significant events. The NSMP may conduct unit health promotion interventions and trainings as command consultation interventions to mitigate behavioral health issues. However, they may not be trained or experienced in conducting some specialized behavioral health trainings. When indicated, the chaplain or JAG can conduct specialized training. The NSMP should be equipped to provide basic trainings/interventions: ➢ Sleep hygiene in a deployed setting. ➢ Basic self-care (rest/diet/exercise). ➢ Healthy coping skills. ➢ Stress management/solution focused skills. ➢ Morale promoting events, such as team building events. ➢ Q&A sessions to discuss unit concerns in an open forum. ➢ Access to relevant resources.",

    "text": "    CHAPTER 1 Scope of Healthcare Provider Responsibilities These clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) apply to deployed human healthcare providers (HCPs) in combat or austere areas of operations. Veterinary care is established at multiple locations throughout theater, and the veterinary health care team is the MWD’s primary provider. However, HCPs are often the only medical person­ nel available to MWDs that are critically ill or injured. The reality is that HCPs will routinely manage working dogs in emergencies before they are ever seen by veterinary personnel. Care by HCPs is limited to circumstances in which the dog is too unstable to transport to supporting veterinary facilities or medical evacuation is not possible due to weather or mission constraints; immediate care is neces­ sary to preserve life, limb, or eyesight; and veterinary personnel are not available. HCPs should only perform medical or surgical procedures – within the scope of their training or experience – necessary to manage prob­ lems that immediately threaten life, limb, or eyesight, and to prepare the dog for evacuation to definitive vet­ erinary care. Routine medical, dental, or surgical care is not to be provided by HCPs. Emergent surgical management of injured MWDs may be necessary by HCPs to afford a chance at patient sur­ vival. This should be considered only if: The provider has the necessary advanced surgical training and experience. The provider feels there is a reasonable likelihood of success. The provider has the necessary support staff, facilities, and monitoring and intensive care facilities to manage the post-operative MWD without compromising human patient care. Emergent surgical management should be considered only in Role 2 or higher medical facilities and by trained surgical specialists with adequate staff. Direct communication with a US military veterinarian is essential before considering surgical management, and during and after surgery, to optimize outcome. Considerations Working dogs operated by allied military forces and DoD contractors may be presented for medical care by HCPs. Established agreements permit HCPs to provide necessary emergency care, just as if these dogs were MWDs. The overarching goal when managing injured dogs is return to normal function and duty (RTD). Within reason, however, consider the adoption potential for dogs. Adoption of MWDs no longer fit for duty is authorized. Many MWDs with career-ending injuries have been successfully managed and ultimately adopted, some suffering these injuries while deployed. Consider emergency care, even if RTD is not likely but adoption is pos­ sible. HCPs should be reasonable, however, when considering the extent to which resources are allocated; dogs with multiple limb amputations or severe brain injury, for example, are not adoptable. Information concerning MWDs (e.g., unit of assignment, operating location, illness or injury data, functional status) should be considered confidential and treated as such. 4",

    "text": "    General Handling and Management of MWDs MWDs are unpredictable and potentially dangerous animals, especially when ill, injured, or stressed, and es­ pecially when not under the control of a trained handler. The dog handler is the best person to control the MWD; they have the most accurate information about past medical problems and the current situation, and they have first aid training and can assist in care. The MWD unit is responsible for providing a handler at all times. Safety of HCPs and bystanders is paramount: Never examine a MWD without a handler present. Remove MWDs from areas where handlers are being treated; instances have occurred when MWDs aggressed on HCPs that the dog felt were threatening the handler. MWDs should be muzzled whenever being handled, unless medical issues prevent muzzling. Standard muzzles issued to handlers are ideal; however, roll gauze can be used for temporary control, looped tightly around the muzzle twice, and tied behind the head. Remove the muzzle when not actively han­ dling the dog, if the dog is sedated or anesthetized, if the dog is having breathing difficulty, or if tempera­ ture extremes prevent cooling by panting. MWDs must be controlled and supervised at all times, especially if sedated or anesthetized. A handler must be immediately available 24 hours a day when MWDs are in a facility. MWDs must never be transported without a handler. If available, portable kennels are the best means of transport for stable MWDs. If a portable kennel is not available, MWDs transported in aircraft should be muzzled if their medical condition permits. Evaluation and Treatment Tips Note: Chapters 2-22 guide HCPs in management of specific scenarios involving life- or limb-threatening prob­ lems with MWDs. Some supplies and equipment are unique to managing dogs, or differ from that used on people. Experience shows it is ideal to centrally locate these items in the area where injured dogs will be managed. Coordinate with supporting veterinary personnel for these items. Examples are dog hair clippers, dog muzzles, canine oxygen face masks, neonatal and pediatric blood pressure cuffs, and size 10mm and 11mm endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes. Durable medical equipment should be routinely disinfected for re-use, as is done after use on human patients. MWDs with a catheter or bandage of any kind, or with wounds of any kind should be prevented from self- trauma and removal of devices. The simplest options for preventing self-trauma and device removal are ei­ ther a loose-fitting muzzle (short-term use only) or application of a modified plastic bucket with the bottom cut off, secured around the neck using a collar (See Figures 21 and Figure 22). Liberally clip hair at catheter sites, and around all wounds and over traumatized areas to reveal areas of “hidden” injury that might otherwise be missed. 5",

The hallmark immediate treatment of MV includes rapid assessment and determination of the need for emergent abdominal surgery, and aggressive shock therapy – err on the side of emergent abdominal laparotomy if clinical signs and imaging suggest MV. It is unlikely the dog can be evacuated soon enough to veterinary facilities, so be prepared to operate in the MTF. Extended monitoring for common life-threatening sequellae is required in the post-operative period. Treat shock: • Provide 100% oxygen (See Chapter 4). • Administer intravenous fluids to targeted endpoints (See Chapter 6, Figure 33). Perform emergent exploratory laparotomy: • It is essential to begin to counter shock as you prepare for surgery. • Surgical goals are to confirm the diagnosis, determine surgical options, and assess prognosis. • Surgical management includes an approach through the ventral midline under general anesthesia (See Chapter 16), with the dog in dorsal recumbency, to expose the abdominal cavity. • Operative management by resection and anastomosis should only be considered if the following conditions are met: • The duodenum is intact in its entirety; • At least 2cm of healthy ileum is present; • At least 50% of the jejunum is assessed to be viable; • No large bowel is affected. • Abdominal wall closure is in 3 layers: 0 non-absorbable simple interrupted linea alba closure; 2-0 absorbable simple continuous subcutaneous closure; routine skin closure. Euthanasia should be considered for an MWD presenting in extremis, or in dogs that fail to respond to therapy, that deteriorate despite care, or in which operative management is not feasible (See Chapter 21).

    "text": "         CHAPTER 10 Hypothermia and Cold Injuries Hypothermia in MWDs may be caused by exposure to low environmental temperatures (primary hypothermia), or low body temperature due to trauma, toxicity, underling illness, or anesthesia and surgery (secondary hypothermia).1 Most commonly, HCPs will be presented with dogs suffering secondary hypothermia. Classification of Hypothermia MWDs with primary hypothermia can apparently tolerate much more severe hypothermia than MWDs with secondary hypothermia, and adverse effects due to hypothermia have been reported in dogs with secondary hypothermia at significantly closer-to-normal temperatures than patients with primary hypothermia.1 • Primary hypothermia is classified as mild (90-99° F), moderate (82-90° F), severe (68-82° F), or profound (less than 68° F). • Secondary hypothermia is classified as mild (98-99.9° F), moderate (96-98° F), severe (92-96° F), or profound (less than 92° F). Management of Hypothermia • Warm hypothermic MWDs rapidly but carefully. Anticipate possible complications. Cardiovascular support (principally IV fluid therapy), management of co-existing problems, and prevention of rewarming complications are necessary (See Table 13). • Rewarm MWDs at a target rate of increase of 2-4° F per hour. • Use a combination of methods based on the severity of hypothermia and the MWD’s status. • Rewarm MWDs with mild hypothermia and normovolemia using passive surface warming. Apply external blankets, towels, or other devices to prevent heat loss while the animal ‘self-generates’ heat. These measures will not be effective as sole measures if shivering is absent.1 • Rewarm MWDs with moderate hypothermia using active surface warming. • Use externally-applied heat sources such as forced-air devices, warm water bottles, or warm-water circulating heating pads to provide heat to offset the patient’s inability to generate heat. • Provide IV fluid volume support to maintain normotension and prevent rewarming shock (See Chapter 6, Figure 33).

Avoid giving drugs, to include anti-arrhythmic agents, until the body temperature is >90°, as drugs are believed ineffective at temperatures below this.1,5 • HCPs must be aware that measures to correct hypothermia can actually cause complications to develop, such as “afterdrop” and “rewarming shock;” thus, careful warming and close monitoring are essential when managing hypothermic patients.3,5 • “Afterdrop” is the continued decrease in core temperature as warming is provided, due to the return of cold peripheral blood to the central circulation. To prevent “afterdrop,” it is important to warm the patient’s trunk (chest and abdomen), not the extremities. • “Rewarming shock” develops with excessively rapid warming and is due to the sudden development of systemic vasodilatation. This vasodilatation causes hypotension at a time when the circulatory system may not be able to react. The systemic hypotension is aggravated by the increased metabolic demand that develops as hypothermic patients are rewarmed, which increases the demand for perfusion. To prevent or reduce “rewarming shock,” IV fluid therapy must be provided and assessment of volume status (e.g., serial body weight measurement, clinical signs of hydration), systemic blood pressure, and tissue perfusion (e.g., evaluation of CRT, lactate clearance, change in mentation, urine output) must be monitored carefully. Cold-induced Injury Cold-induced injuries include non-freezing and freezing injuries, typically to an extremity, and tend to be relat­ ed to geographic location (i.e., freezing climates) and use of the animal (e.g., search dogs). Non-freezing Injury Non-freezing injuries typically involve the extremities, occur despite the tissue not actually freezing, and are commonly due to prolonged cold exposure. In humans, common terms to describe these types of injuries are “chilblains” and “immersion foot” or “trench foot;” similar terms are not used in veterinary medicine. With non-freezing injuries, extremities (ear pinnae, paws, tail tip, scrotum) are exposed to cold temperatures above freezing for prolonged periods (>12 hours), causing intense erythema of the skin, pain, and pruritus. If skin is exposed to damp conditions or submerged and exposed to cold, tissue edema and maceration may also develop. Treatment of non-freezing cold injuries involves removing the MWD from the cold environment and passively warming the affected tissues slowly. Passive warming of non-freezing injuries can be accomplished by moving the MWD to a warm room (e.g., hospitalize, indoor facility) and gently wrapping the patient or affected body part in warm blankets or towels.

    "text": "      Freezing Injury Freezing injury, or “frostbite,” is the development of cold injury in which tissues actually become frozen, with crystallization (ice formation) of tissue and cell water. Frostbite is seen at environmental temperatures below 32° F and primarily affects the distal extremities, ears, nose, scrotum, and tail. Frostbite varies in severity from superficial (1st degree frostbite) to deep injury (4th degree frostbite). Clinical signs of superficial frostbite (1st and 2nd degree frostbite) include a grey-to-white, waxy appearance of affected skin; blistering of affected skin may be present with 2nd degree frostbite. Clinical signs of deep frostbite (3rd and 4th degree frostbite) include involvement of the entire epidermis, but no subcutaneous tissues (3rd degree) to involvement of subcutaneous tissues, to possibly include muscle and bone (4th degree frostbite). Tissues affected with deep frostbite may be black and friable. In all cases of frostbite, pain may be intense, especially during rewarming of tissues. Management of MWDs with freezing injury is summarized in Table 14 on the next page. Treatment of frost­ bite involves rapid warming of affected tissues, overall patient management (e.g., treatment of whole-body hypothermia, trauma, or shock as appropriate), analgesia, and protection of affected tissues. • Affected tissues may be warmed by immersion in a water bath that is 104-108° F for at least 20 minutes or until thawing has occurred, or by wrapping the affected tissue with warm, wet towels for 15 to 20 minutes, changing the towels every 5 minutes. • Do not use dry heat to warm tissues, and never rub or massage the tissues, as further injury may occur. • Provide systemic analgesia (See Chapter 16), as frostbite is extremely painful. • Protect the affected tissues by applying loose protective bandages, minimizing movement (confine to a cage), and attaching a bucket-collar device (See Figure 21 and Figure 22) to prevent self-trauma. • Antibiotic use is not recommended. • Aseptically aspirate large blisters that develop.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 8: Behavioral Health Impact of Mass Casualty Incidents 4 MANAGING IMPACT ON SERVICE MEMBERS AND MEDICAL NSMPS – PREVENTATIVE LEVELS OF CARE Preventative care is defined as taking place at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Primary preventative strategies are interventions to mitigate the occurrence of the disease/disorder. An example of this would be the use of an immunization to increase one’s resistance to a pathogen. This level of preventative care also applies to behavioral health. Military‐wide initiatives to foster resilience are designed to act as primary intervention strategies to foster well‐ being and reduce impact on mission accomplishment. An embedded NSMP has numerous advantages to traditional specialty behavioral health services in providing primary and secondary preventative care. Primary preventative care involves interventions designed to mitigate the potential of behavioral health distress interfering with performance of the mission. Secondary preventative care involves interventions tailored to reduce the likelihood of a more severe, chronic condition developing. The final level of care, tertiary prevention, addresses a known behavioral condition, aiming to reduce symptoms and manage the condition. The following sections review the relevant domains in which an NSMP can support their unit command before, during, and following an MCI. Pre‐MCI: Primary Preventative Care That traditional paradigm for behavioral health services has been at large hospitals centralized in outpatient clinics. This system is primarily geared towards tertiary preventative care through identification of a diagnosable behavioral condition. Trainings, as well as conducting test exercises so as to make personnel aware that their roles will change during a MASCAL, would help both service members and NSMPs be prepared in the event of a MASCAL. Embedded NSMP Proximity: The proximity of these medical personnel to the unit’s daily operations provides a comprehensive perspective in the challenges facing their formation and ample opportunity to intervene. MCI: Secondary Preventative Care‐‐ Early Diagnosis and Prompt Treatment. Identifying Individuals Struggling during the MASCAL Effective management of MASCAL event requires planning, coordination, and communication. Goals of responding assets are to bring medical and other essential resources to casualties when the system within the area of operations is overwhelmed and unable to provide the desirable standard of care to all affected. Individuals, teams, units and the entire community need to be prepared to respond quickly and efficiently to prevent, moderate, or avoid both the physical and psychological impact of the MCI. Key preventive and management steps include the 5 Rs.12 The following section reviews the 5 Rs to prepare both the NSMP as well as the unit for successful trauma response‐‐ namely resources, rehearsal, response, route (described in Chapter 7, MEDEVAC), and rest. Given that features of route, namely transport and accountability have been covered in Chapter 7, it will not be expanded in this chapter. 1. Resources: The primary concern in the event of MASCAL is the safety of the unit. Although security of the service members is not a medical responsibility, it needs to be addressed by NSMPs at all echelons of care. Avoidable injuries to the unit, including NSMPs, can have significant impact on mission readiness. Ensuring security, e.g., confirming effective enemy action has ended before rushing to treat affected individuals, is one of the foundations of safe and effective care. The current military casualty triage and evacuation system uses a model of echelons of care described in Chapters 1 and 7. Being familiar with available resources and local host nation capabilities, which could be leveraged to augment a unit’s MASCAL response, is critical. Also, having trained and ready personnel is an invaluable asset in austere environments. Since units most often have limited time together before deployment, common training can enhance cohesive unit response in theater as well as identify capable people whose skills could be leveraged in the event of a MASCAL. Finally, familiarity with medevac procedures (chapter 7), as well as competent cultural assistance, is crucial in international trauma response.",

    "text": "Definitive Diagnosis of GDV Confirmation of GDV is based on abdominal radiographs that demonstrate marked gastric dilation with air (See Figure 40). Radiography, if available, is recommended if there is doubt about the diagnosis, as other con­ ditions (e.g., hemoperitoneum, abdominal neoplasia, ascites) mimic some of the signs of GDV. Generally, a single right lateral radiograph is sufficient. Management of GDV A management algorithm is provided (See Figure 41). The hallmark immediate treatment of GDV includes rapid decompression of gas from the dilated stomach, shock therapy, monitoring for complications, repeated decompression if dilation recurs, and rapid evacuation to veterinary facilities for definitive surgery. GDV is a surgical emergency; surgery is required to derotate the stomach and perform gastropexy, and to perform partial gastric resection or splenectomy if warranted, with extended monitoring for common life-threatening sequellae in the post-operative period.

If this portion of the CPG is substantial and contains multiple paragraphs of considerable length, please add key points in bullet format at the beginning of each section under this heading. Determine key points and highlight any sentences or key points that should be emphasized in the call out boxes or tables. If there are highly important points, communicate with the JTS CPG team to include them in the Infographic. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT (PI) MONITORING Please use current PI metrics in the CPG and highlight anything that should be added, updated, or removed. Please ensure that the metrics enumerated in this section are addressed/mentioned/explained in the body of the CPG as appropriate. The PI metrics play a crucial role in each CPG and should be carefully considered. If something is a PI metric, then it will be tracked by not only the JTS PI team, but also in the DoDTR. So, for example if the CPG states: “it is crucial to receive _______therapy within ______amount of time,” then both the PI team (for compliance/variance reports) and the DoDTR team will need to track that metric. There should be no less than two and no more than 10 CPG compliance metrics. REFERENCES Conduct an updated literature review to determine if any new data has been published on the CPG topic and update all references accordingly. DOTMLPF-P CONSIDERATIONS (IF APPROPRIATE) This section has been added to all new and updated CPGs to ensure the JTS CPGs can be used as a guide for leaders/commanders so that clinical care in the operational environment has the appropriate attention and gaps are identiﬁed. This section is primarily for commanders, including non-medical commanders. It is to support medical units and can be used as a communication tool to list the resources needed to care for the patient addressed by the CPG. This section will not address clinical care, but rather the needs of the unit in order to perform the clinical care described in the CPG. DOTMLPF-P is a tool which allows leaders to analyze organizational capabilities from the perspective of “Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy” when making decisions and resource determinations. This section is meant as a communication tool for teams, units, and command surgeons to ground medical units, clinical care, and clinical standards in an operational framework. This will be challenging and require thought. Not every domain element will be relevant for a CPG and may be left blank. This framework as a CPG appendix is to initiate administrative, training, personnel, material, and acquisition eﬀorts to support best practices for the speciﬁc combat casualty clinical scenario addressed in the CPG. DOPTMLPF-P is mission focused, whereas the mission of the CPG is to address the clinical needs of the combat casualty. This section is meant to support what is necessary and drive any changes for gaps that are identiﬁed in the clinical care that the CPG addresses. In summary, this section is meant to deﬁne a ‘capability need’ or the ‘capability gap’ to accomplish the mission, which is the care of the casualty, and identify the needed capabilities to treat the casualty according to the clinical guidance described in the CPG. See the DOTMF-P components descriptions on the next page.",

Best:  Utilize short‐term psychopharmacological management (see Chapter 5) until symptoms abate. Options include:  Haloperidol lactate 5 MG IM, preferably combined with diphenhydramine 25 MG IM is the recommended approach.  A dose of Lorazepam 2 MG IM to counter the side effects of haloperidol can be added.  The use of olanzapine ODT 5 MG in the mouth is an effective alternative. It is fast acting and does not need the addition of any other medication to it.  An injectable form of an antipsychotic with a benzodiazepine might be needed in case of acute psychosis with harm to self or others where hospitalization is not yet possible. SUICIDE RISK Suicide is a condition with a complex etiology, yet it can also be prevented. Suicide‐related events (SREs) occurring in deployed settings include suicide deaths, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation with a plan and intent to die. Suicidal behavior across this spectrum of severity can impact the health and wellbeing of military units, including helping professionals, peers, and leadership. In far‐forward environments, consequences of suicidal behavior include loss of personnel, commander’s preoccupation with the issue, impact on service member morale, and threats to lethality and mission readiness of the unit. Medics, peers, chaplains, and leaders each serve a specific and a collaborative role in the decision‐making process regarding management of SREs in deployed settings. Medics conduct assessments and provide therapy and/or medication; peers serve as support; chaplains counsel service members on religious and moral issues; and leaders collaborate and consult with the team to identify at‐risk service members needing referrals and ultimately decide on a course of action. Prevention efforts include risk assessment, referral, and hospitalization for management by specialty care, if needed. The focus of this section is to provide an overview of suicide risk assessment and recommendations on management in far‐forward environments. SUICIDE RISK: RULE OUTS Service members may express thoughts about dying without any true desire to be dead. They may also engage in non‐ suicidal self‐injury such as cutting or burning their skin, without an intent to die. However, such self‐injurious behaviors can still unintentionally result in death or the need for medical attention, and should be taken seriously. It is possible that suicidal thoughts or behaviors could be related to symptoms of psychosis (e.g., command hallucinations), other co‐ occurring behavioral health condition (e.g., PTSD), or substance use, but this can be difficult to determine without a more thorough assessment or appropriate training. As previously mentioned, in many cases of suicide, there is not a known underlying behavioral health condition.28,29 Thus, even in the absence of depression or other behavioral health issues, stressors and crises (e.g., relationship problems, legal issues, physical health issues, job/financial concerns) should be taken seriously and attended to as potential risk factors for suicide, and taken into consideration regarding supportive services.",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non-Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 6: Command Consultation 3 any legal/ethical issues, potential consequences, and how/to whom to refer. It is critically important for the NSMP to understand the unit structures and functions and the service member’s specific job duties and role in the unit, and to consider how that may relate to command-related actions to minimize risk and/or to maximize performance. Clinical assessment guidelines and behavioral health screening tools for the NSMP are described in Chapters 2-4. ANALYZE POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS AND DEVELOP ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS Overall, the NSMP will consider four general disposition options: return to duty, return to duty with short-term limitations, medical hold, and refer. The NSMP must determine what options/resources are available in the current environment to include potential duty limitations, availability of behavioral health specialty providers (such as through tele-behavioral health intervention or restoration clinic; see Chapter 1), prescription medications (see Chapter 5), medical hold (see Chapter 1), medevac (see Chapter 7), and practical actions that command can take. For clinical conditions, the NSMP may apply the recommended “minimum/better/best” interventions from Chapters 3 and 4 and may consult with a tele-behavioral health NSMP as needed. For many presenting concerns, command can take immediate and practical actions to ameliorate the underlying issues and stressors or to provide safety for a service member at risk. These wide-ranging command-related actions include altering the mission rest times to increase sleep opportunity; ensuring the service member can voice relevant concerns to command; referring the service member to a chaplain, judge advocate general (JAG), or the inspector general (IG), depending on the nature of the problem; ensuring that a unit mentor meets regularly with the service member to assist with relationship, financial, or occupational problems; and ensuring contact between a victim of sexual assault and the unit’s victim advocate and SARC. Safety interventions include instituting appropriate unit watch procedures and firearms/weapons/medications safety limitations. See Table 6.2 for a detailed NSMP guide to match specific problems to immediate interventions on which command can take action. Table 6.2. Command Consultation Tool for Evaluation and Command-Related Interventions for Individual Service Member Concerns. Concerning Issues Command-Related Interventions Sleep Is the service member sleeping less than 4 hours per 24-hour period for a duration of more than one month? Revisit planned mission rest times to ensure eight hours of downtime for intended sleep. Provide sleep hygiene training. (See Chapter 4 for clinical recommendations) Self-harm/Suicidal Risk Has the service member recently expressed thoughts of self-harm or made attempts to harm self? Establish appropriate unit watch procedures and firearms and other safety limitations (e.g., restrict medication access, if appropriate) until the service member can be medically evacuated at the earliest opportunity. (See Chapter 3 for clinical recommendations and Chapter 7 for Medevac guidance) Anger/Homicidal Risk Has the service member had any significant outbursts or times when the service member might be considered “out of control”? Ensure that the service member has adequate opportunity to voice frustrations to command. Consider referral to Chaplain. NSMP to monitor service member for outbursts at least weekly.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non-Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 6: Command Consultation 13 impact on the unit, and the availability of resources. The NSMP and the commanding officer will collaborate together and consider these factors in their development of the intervention plan. Simple situations might involve a lack of sufficient sleep leading to increased irritability and some mild attention or memory problems, which could potentially be resolved by the commanding officer ensuring the affected leader has sufficient time to catch up on and maintain adequate sleep. A step further might entail that the affected leader take a few days to rest and replenish close to, but outside of, the unit, and be re-evaluated by a NSMP prior to return. For other relatively simple clinical conditions, the NSMP may apply the recommended “minimum/better/best” interventions from Chapters 3 and 4, consulting with a tele-behavioral health provider as needed. Additionally, command can take a host of practical actions to mitigate the underlying operational issues and stressors. However, if the affected leader is resistant to these interventions, then the seemingly simple situation becomes complex. Other situations may start out as more complex, for example, command might experience excessive, debilitating guilt and impaired functioning after the unit suffers heavy losses in a mission. As a rule of thumb, any complex situation involving command consultation for leaders requires that the NSMP consult with the tele-behavioral health provider and/or the chaplain for guidance, sharing observations, survey data, and related findings with them and developing feasible recommendations for action. PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND COLLABORATE WITH THE CO TO DETERMINE INTERVENTION PLAN After the NSMP has gathered relevant information, consulted with the tele-behavioral health provider if needed, and developed clinical and command-related recommendations, the NSMP should brief the commanding officer on their findings within 24 hours, adhering to confidentiality requirements outlined above. The NSMP and the affected leader’s commanding officer should discuss the NSMP’s assessment and recommendations and determine the best plan to manage the problem, depending on the situation and circumstance. For serious concerns, the NSMP should complete a written report of the command consultation within 24 hours (see Appendix G, NSMP Behavioral Health Communication Form). Feedback to the leader with behavioral health concerns should be delivered verbally by the NSMP and should include information regarding diagnosis, prognosis, duty limitations, recommendations, and plan. If the NSMP and commanding officer agree that it would be helpful, the NSMP may also share additional feedback such as general and anonymous observations by unit members, leaders, and medical staff; unit survey results; and the suspected impact of the leader’s behavioral health issues on the unit. If desired, the NSMP may enlist the support of the chaplain or a trusted officer to accompany them to share feedback. The NSMP should employ basic communication strategies such as active listening and motivational interviewing discussed in Chapter 1. Implement Plan, Evaluate and Adjust as Necessary The delicate area of intervening with command may bring up special and possibly unforeseen circumstances, depending on the receptivity of the leader with behavioral health concerns and the commanding officer, as well as the nature of the presenting concerns and available intervention options. The intervention plan may include clinical and command- related interventions and may be relatively simple or more complex, with several components, pertinent key personnel, and/or stages that require coordination. As the plan is implemented, it will be evaluated as needed to determine its effectiveness. This requires the NSMP and command to monitor the leader and re-evaluate their status and to continue to gather relevant information from pertinent sources. If selected items from the Unit-IQ were administered and showed toxic leadership concerns, the same items can be re-administered to track the effectiveness of the intervention(s) and the resulting impact on the unit. The intervention plan should be adjusted as needed to suit changes in the leader’s behavioral health status, such that if the leader fails to improve or worsens, stronger measures should be",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 8: Behavioral Health Impact of Mass Casualty Incidents 3 This proximity engenders a greater degree of buy‐in from unit command and increased collaboration and provides a valuable opportunity to increase unit‐level resilience, screening, and prevention measures to ensure long‐term behavioral health readiness. In far‐forward locations, the access to specialty behavioral health services is limited (see Chapter 1). This section will discuss the command and unit factors, which influence the behavioral health functioning role of the NSMP in ensuring long‐term unit readiness through their interaction with their units. Relatedly, trauma and the associated behavioral health impact does not discriminate between the unit’s command, medical personnel, and frontline service members. It is highly probable that embedded NSMPs must make efforts to mitigate the behavioral health impact of MCIs for their command, peer service members, and for themselves. Fortunately, embedded NSMPs are well placed to provide or advise preventative measures to mitigate the impact on their formation. Every service member experiencing trauma due to a combat event triggers a triage or sorting to align available resources with needs. However, when these needs overwhelm or surpass available resources, it becomes a mass casualty event that necessitates the launch of a series of rehearsed strategies to achieve the greatest benefit for the maximum number of affected individuals. Intensity, number of casualties, location of the unit, and the environment contribute to the estimate of caregiving capacity load. In austere environments, a single complex injury, such as blast injury with behavioral impact evidenced by panic attack and agitation as well as multiple fractures or open wound requiring surgery, can eliminate a unit’s ability to deliver additional casualty care, while more than two such patients needing surgical and behavioral health care has the potential to max out unit capabilities. BARRIERS TO NSMPS SEEKING MENTAL HEALTH CARE MCIs may have a disastrous impact on a unit’s readiness to accomplish its mission, through both the catastrophic damage to medical readiness and the commitment of operational resources to meet the overwhelming medical demand.11 During MCIs, front‐line NSMPs (e.g., medics, corpsmen, physician assistants) must manage limited time and inadequate resources while maximizing care for the greatest number of people. A complementary objective for NSMPs in far‐forward locations is to identify soldiers who can be treated rapidly and return to duty (RTD).4 NSMPs are a critical force multiplier in enhancing medical readiness, whether it be their assistance in evacuation of service members to specialty care NSMPs or the utilization of brief, evidence‐based interventions to facilitate RTD. Psychiatric casualties during an MCI have both short‐term and long‐term consequences for the medical health readiness. In the short term, the loss of experienced service members from the immediate battlefield could directly impact the success of the mission. The loss of key unit leaders at the frontline would not only directly hamper immediate operational performance, but the lag time for resupply and retraining of these leaders would reduce performance for weeks. Long‐term consequences of psychiatric casualties are related to service‐related disability, long‐term specially care, and adverse impact on military families, including social, economic, and other quality of life impacts.8 Despite the importance of behavioral health care, service members may be reluctant to seek such care. Reasons for the reluctance to seek care include the commitment of NSMP to serving the mission and the unit and failing to notice or ignoring functional impairments in themselves. Additional reasons include stigma and career concerns. Service members may also purposely avoid behavioral health care due to concerns about how others might view them or the potential impact on their career.",

    "text": "         Definitive Surgical Management of GDV Evacuate the MWD to a veterinary facility as soon as it is stabilized. Any MWD with GDV should be considered an URGENT casualty. Definitive surgical management – consisting of exploratory laparotomy, derotation of the stomach, gastropexy, and possible partial gastric resection and/or splenectomy – requires trained personnel intimate with the anatomy and physiology of the dog. Emergency surgical exploration of the abdomen and attempted surgical management of GDV by HCPs in the deployed setting may be necessary if evacuation will be delayed more than 4-6 hours. • It is essential to counter shock and stabilize the dog before considering operative management. • Surgical management includes an approach through the ventral midline under general anesthesia, with the dog in dorsal recumbency, to expose the abdominal cavity (See Chapter 16.) • GDV is confirmed once the abdomen is open by identifying a dilated stomach covered by omentum. • The stomach is de-rotated to its normal position by grasping the stomach on both extreme lateral aspects simultaneously, and rotating the stomach counterclockwise (when viewed from the dog‘s right side in dor­ sal recumbency). • A markedly tympanic stomach may need to be further decompressed by intraoperative needle decompres­ sion with suction to allow adequate manipulation. • Typically, the gastric wall has variable degrees of bruising, especially at the cardia, and may have devel­ oped partial- or full-thickness necrosis. If bruising persists or worsens intraoperatively, or if gastric wall ne­ crosis is suspected, perform a partial gastrectomy of suspect gastric wall. Gastrectomy is ideally performed using TA or GIA surgical stapling equipment or an inverting double-layer gastric wall suture pattern of non­ absorbable suture. Note that postoperative mortality in dogs that require gastrectomy is approximately 25 -35%, compared to mortality <10% in dogs that do not require gastrectomy. • Typically, intra-abdominal bleeding is encountered due to rupture of the short gastric arteries and/or splenic injury. Assess the viability of the spleen and perform splenectomy if splenic thrombosis, marked splenic vessel injury and bleeding, or splenic lacerations are noted. Arcade ligation, with special attention to the major splenic vessels, is optimal, and is best done with LDS stapling equipment (for vessels <4 mm diameter) and suture ligation (for vessels >4 mm diameter) using transfixation sutures. • Perform an incisional gastropexy (to prevent future GDV). Create a 3-4 cm incision in the seromuscular lay­ er of the right pyloric area of the stomach wall. Create a similarly-sized incision in the right ventrolateral abdominal wall musculature. Appose the margins of the gastric wall incision against the margins of the in­ cision in the abdominal wall musculature and create a gastropexy by suturing each margin using 0 or 2-0 non-absorbable suture. • Abdominal wall closure is in 3 layers: 0 non-absorbable simple interrupted linea alba closure; 2-0 absorba­ ble simple continuous subcutaneous closure; routine skin closure.

    "text": "     • Apply a tertiary layer, typically consisting of non-adherent conforming bandage, adhesive bandage, or both. This layer holds the dressing and secondary layer in place, provides additional support, and provides more durable protection of the underlying layers. In most cases, the tertiary layer is applied just tight enough to hold the bandage in place, and without compression. • Change bandages at least once daily. More frequent bandage changes may be necessary if the wound has a heavy discharge or the bandage becomes soiled or partially removed by the MWD. Once wound discharge is reduced and a healthy granulation bed has formed, bandage changes become less frequent, generally every 2-3 days. • Any MWD with a bandage applied must be prevented from chewing at the bandage. A plastic bucket with the bottom cut out can be used to prevent self-trauma can be attached to the dog‘s collar as an effective prevention practice (See Figure 21 and Figure 22). • Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT; e.g., WoundVac®) has proven a viable treatment modality for wounds in dogs, but requires proper training to apply properly to dogs and frequently heavy sedation of the MWD to prevent disruption of the dressing. HCPs with experience with NPWT are encouraged to consult with supporting veterinary personnel if this treatment modality is considered necessary before the MWD is evacuated to a veterinary facility. In most cases, application of NPWT can be delayed until the MWD is evacuated to a veterinary facility for long-term care. • A “tie-over” bandage should be used in locations that are difficult to place a bandage, such as the inguinal area, dorsum, hip, and flank. Routine bandages placed in these areas typically slip off, and fail to protect the wound. A tie-over bandage consists of the same layers of bandage material, whether adherent or non -adherent, placed within and over the wound in a packing fashion. Multiple suture loops are placed around the periphery of the wound in the skin, evenly spaced around the wound, using large (2-0 or larger) monofilament suture material. The wound is then covered with a portion of impermeable drape or similar material. The bandage is then secured using umbilical tape or Figure 44. Tie-Over Bandage. similar material laced through the suture loops (see Figure 44). Ties of surgical masks are a good substitute if umbilical tape is not available. The ties should be sufficiently tight to hold the bandage in place, with mild tension on the suture loops. The covering layer should be snug over the top of the underlying layers. A tie-over bandage will not have a compression layer. Antibiotic Use with Open or Necrotic Wounds Systemic antibiotics are indicated for any MWD with moderate or severe wounds. Wound cultures are indicated at admission if the patient presents with a dirty/infected wound, if obvious infection develops during any phase of wound management, if the wound fails to heal normally, or if systemic signs of infection develop. Continue antibiotics for a minimum of 7 days (See Table 19). 79 Wound Management",

    "text": "Introduction 3 INTRODUCTION his clinical practice guideline (CPG) describes strategies for general medical personnel (e.g., medics and general physician assistants (PAs) who do not have extensive education and training in behavioral health. Increasingly in modern warfare, units find themselves in environments where medical evacuation is delayed or not possible and embedded medical personnel must assess and manage conditions with limited resources. Given these demands, these guidelines lay out basic principles and strategies for assessment and management of a wide range of behavioral health conditions in a resource-scarce environment. Therefore, the primary audience for this guideline is non-specialty personnel (e.g., general physician assistant or operational medical personnel), corpsmen, and medics at far-forward locations when specialty behavioral health care or consultation is not immediately available. The text is meant to be an informative consolidation of resources that would benefit a range of medical personnel from medics to credentialed providers who may not have had specialty training but must contend with the reality of emergent behavioral health needs. The term, non-specialty medical personnel (NSMP), is used throughout the text to refer to this broad audience. When providing care for the service members, it is essential to keep in mind that medical personnel make recommendations, but command makes the decisions. Commanders are responsible for the health and well-being of service members in their command and all interventions are dependent on the mission, operational environment, and operational conditions. Each role of care in the deployed environment during the past two decades has been associated with a specific level of behavioral health support (discussed in Chapter 1). At Role 1, facilities (such as battalion aid stations) typically received direct support from behavioral health technicians and rotational support from behavioral health officers. Role 2 facilities provided direct support through uniformed behavioral health officers (BHOs) or through combat stress control (COSC) prevention teams. From these Role 2 facilities, uniformed providers conducted battlefield circulation and outreach to address behavioral health needs at smaller bases and Role 1 facilities. Large, fixed facilities with direct support from a division psychiatrist typically were available at Role 3 facilities. These Role 3 facilities often were co-located with combat stress restoration clinics that provided three-to-five-day respite and treatment programs. The future of 21st century warfare will likely prevent several aspects of behavioral health support that have been relied upon in previous wars. Contested airspace and advanced air defense likely will delay medical evacuation of low-priority behavioral patients. The same factors that disrupt patient movement also will prevent regular battlefield circulation, particularly in large-scale combat operations and areas of operation that are larger than in previous wars. Fixed behavioral health and combat stress facilities at Role 3 may also not be available due to requirements for rapid movement in a changing battlespace. Although telehealth has significant capability in delivering behavioral health services, disruption of network infrastructure by adversaries may prevent the systematic use of telehealth in future combat environments. GAPS IN RESEARCH & PRACTICE: FAR FORWARD BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE The provision of far-forward medical care in the combat theater is essential to both mission success and the well-being of individual service members. The changing nature of conflict and future multi-domain operations likely will prohibit forward staging of definitive specialty care support in all operating areas due to wide geographic dispersion of high numbers of small teams/units performing operations of varied intensity. Far forward care in such operations would thus T",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel be critical to promoting front‐line coping as well as early recognition and management of combat stress in the far‐ forward environment. COMBAT LIFESAVER The combat lifesaver is a bridge between the self‐aid/buddy‐aid and combat medic and functions in the role of supportive buddy aid. The combat lifesaver is a non‐medical service member who provides lifesaving measures as a secondary mission as allowed by the primary (combat) mission. The combat lifesaver may also assist the combat medic in providing care and preparing casualties for evacuation when the combat lifesaver has no combat duties to perform. In the Army, one member of each squad, crew, or equivalent sized unit will be trained as a combat lifesaver. Examples of lifesaver roles include providing combat and operational stress preventive measures such as behavioral health and resiliency training, assisting with iCOVER, and coordinating with external behavioral health services, etc. MEDICS AND ROLE 1 MEDICAL PROVIDERS Access to specialty behavioral health providers or technicians at Role 1 facilities will be greatly diminished with decreased battlefield circulation. Furthermore, while tele‐behavioral health models have historically been utilized to support Role 1 facilities, concerns with bandwidth and signal interruption will likely result in the downgrade in frequency of and reliance on such access to care. Thus, medics and other battalion‐level medical personnel will become the frontline responders for behavioral care, necessitating greater training in psychological concerns typically addressed by behavioral health providers. Currently, medics receive limited training in behavioral health, therefore enhanced training for Role 1 providers must emphasize the most common and most serious differential diagnoses of behavioral health presentations (see Chapters 3 and 4). Furthermore, training must also encapsulate basic initial behavioral and symptom treatment (Chapter 2 to 4), as well as ongoing management of behavioral health concerns. Short‐term behavioral symptom management will be critical as Role 1 medical providers will need to rely on the limited prescription drug formulary available at front‐line locations (as outlined in Chapter 5), with limited access to psychotropic medications. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OPTIONS Behavioral health providers cannot replace the invaluable support provided by fellow service members. The single most important factor in organizational resilience is unit cohesion. All operational behavioral health assets provide training to their units on protective factors related to behavioral health, as well as teaching some form of psychological first aid that includes five core steps, namely: listen, protect, connect, model, and teach. Buddy care is critical in order to prepare teams to support each other when under pressure, prevent behavioral health casualties when possible, and help bridge people into care if they become a behavioral health casualty. Additionally, peer support (buddy care) can help facilitate reintegration of service members when symptoms have subsided. These trainings may be given by a behavioral health provider or technician. The trainings provided within each service branch are doctrinal and developed at the highest echelons of command rather than grown at the unit level in order to ensure consistency. Rotational behavioral health support can be obtained through battlefield circulation from (BHOs based at Role 2 facilities. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TECHNICIANS Behavioral health technicians (Military Occupational Specialty 68Xs in the Army, L24A in the Navy and 4C0X1 in the Air Force) serve a unique role as immediate access points of care among their organic unit, and their innate familiarity with the unit culture allows them to establish trust more readily with other enlisted service members.25 They are a critical Chapter 1: Behavioral Health Assets Typically Available in the Deployed Environment 5",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel BEHAVIORAL MANAGEMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON MINIMUM, BETTER, AND BEST INTERVENTIONS The primary and initial approach to management of anger issues is to de‐escalate irritability, as well as calm the service member. The continuum of minimal, better, and best interventions is described below. Minimum De‐escalation and Self Aid When a service member presents with signs and symptoms of anger, the clinical team should consider a risk management approach and, if possible, complete a behavioral health evaluation to obtain the following information: a) biopsychosocial history, b) family history of expressing anger, c) prior violence, d) general health (e.g., pain, low blood sugar), e) habits (e.g., sleep, diet, recreational drugs), f) environmental stimuli (i.e. factors that may trigger anger), and g) current precipitating factors.47 As indicated earlier, safety of the service member and unit should be the primary focus. If there are indications of risk to self or others, command would need to be consulted and command consultation (as described in Chapter 6) initiated. Expressions of anger and irritability without homicidal or suicidal intent should, at the minimum, be managed using the 5 Rs: Reassurance of normality, Rest, Replenishment of bodily needs, Restoration of confidence, and help with Return to duty. Depending on the severity of the anger, and if anger has been expressed in overt aggression (i.e. physical harm towards the self or others), the following safety measures and actions need to be considered: • Removal of weapon access. • Assignment of one‐to‐one escort or a buddy (typically of the same rank) to monitor movements. • Providing a “no‐contact” order against any targeted individual. • In extreme cases, additional actions that are beyond the purview of medical staff, and more in the lane of military police and command, include administering the Uniform Code of Military Justice action or place in a detention facility as needed. • Warning the targeted individual if a homicide threat had been made by the angry member (i.e. the Supreme Court of California case Tarasoff vs Regents of University of California, indicating that a mental health professional has a duty not only to a patient but also to individuals who are specifically being threatened by a patient).47 • Finally, self‐help aids, such as use of mobile applications. For example, Breate2Relax and PTSD Coach, as well as breathing exercises such as tactical breathing, can also help in regulating anger. BETTER De‐escalation + Buddy Aid + Problem Solving Manifestations of anger are influenced by one’s physiologic hyper‐arousal. For service members with deployment stressors, the flight‐or‐fight response is constantly activated, resulting in high physiologic arousal. Signs of arousal may include increased blood pressure, tightened muscles, increased speech volume and rate, and quickened respirations.42 When a service member presents with signs and symptoms of anger, the clinical team should consider a risk management approach and, if possible, complete a behavioral health evaluation to obtain the following information: • Biopsychosocial history. • Family history of expressing anger.

Is the service member expressing specific threats of violence toward any individuals (including local nationals)? Establish appropriate unit watch procedures and firearms/weapons limitations until the service member can be medically evacuated at the earliest opportunity. (See Chapter 3 for clinical recommendations and Chapter 7 for Medevac guidance) Substance Misuse/Acute Intoxication Is the service member using alcohol or drugs, and/or is the service member currently under the influence or intoxicated? Establish appropriate unit watch procedures and firearms/other safety limitations until the service member can be medically evacuated at the earliest opportunity. (See Chapter 3 for clinical recommendations and Chapter 7 for Medevac guidance) Relationships Is the service member pending and/or planning a divorce/breakup or experiencing other relationship problems (e.g., frequent arguments with spouse/partner, isolation from family, or loss of child custody)? Ensure contact between the service member and a unit mentor who has been through similar relationship problems until the service member achieves the benchmarks set up by the mentor. Ensure the service member has adequate opportunity to meet with the chaplain, or attend tele-behavioral health provider appointments. (See Chapter 4 for clinical recommendations) Is the service member a victim of a sexual assault during deployment who chooses to file an unrestricted report? Coordinate with SARC for confirmation on report classification. Ensure contact with the unit's victim advocate. Keep service member updated regarding status of legal case. Command to consider removal of perpetrator from AOR. Ensure bi-weekly contact with tele-behavioral health provider for follow-up care. Consider referral to chaplain. NSMP to monitor service member’s state closely. (Follow guidance for clinical symptom presentation in Chapters 3 and 4) Has there been a recent death among the service member’s close relatives or friends (whether or not the service member took emergency leave)? Ensure that the service member has the opportunity to speak with the unit chaplain or other support figures. If a service member has been denied requested emergency leave, ensure that the service member has the opportunity to meet directly with the company commander and/or first sergeant in order to discuss the specific reasons for denial. (See Chapters 3 and 4 for clinical recommendations) Financial and Administrative Financial Problems: Does the service member have significant difficulties paying bills or demonstrate obvious signs of poorly considered purchases (e.g., car, home) well outside known estimated income? Ensure contact between the service member and a unit mentor familiar with the service member’s individual situation until the service member achieves the benchmarks set up by the mentor. Ensure the service member has adequate opportunity to attend financial guidance. Discipline/Legal Problems: Is the service member currently under military or civilian investigation for any suspected violations or pending Uniform Code of Military Justice/Article 15 action, administrative separation/elimination, or bar to re- enlistment? Occupational Problems: Is the service member pending any adverse action (e.g., flag, reduction in rank, removal from position of responsibility, poor performance review, or non-selection for promotion or attendance to schools), or receiving repeated corrective counseling statements without alterations in problematic behavior? Ensure adequate contact between the service member and support assets (inspector general, judge advocate general, trial defense service, chaplain). Ensure the service member receives written criteria, unit plan of support, and minimum of weekly feedback for how to meet requirements/standards until the service member achieves the requirements/standard identified. If applicable, ensure the service member has full awareness of command’s intention to initiate administrative separation/elimination. If pending separation/elimination, provide the service member with full access to transition services. Ensure the service member receives written criteria, unit plan of support, and minimum of weekly feedback for how to meet requirements/standards until the service member achieves the requirements/standard identified.

As discussed above, the unit and its sub-populations may be differentially affected by stressors and may require different intervention approaches. When the detailed plan has been determined, it can be implemented, evaluated, and adjusted as necessary. Implement Plan, Evaluate and Adjust as Necessary The intervention plan may be relatively simple or more complex, with several components, pertinent key personnel, and/or stages that require coordination. As the intervention plan is implemented, it will need to be evaluated to determine its effectiveness. This requires the NSMP and command to monitor the unit and re-evaluate its status and to Is there evidence of other operational issues such as boredom, repetitive work, insufficient materials for job, working outside of MOS, unclear or confusing messages and missions? Identify specific issues and impact on behavioral health and morale, provide feedback to command. Strategize practical solutions.

If selected items from the Unit-IQ were administered and showed cause for concern, the same items can be re-administered to track the effectiveness of the intervention(s). The plan should be adjusted to best suit changing circumstances, such as increases or decreases in operational tempo or environmental stressors. UNIT CONSULT CASE VIGNETTE Presenting Issues An infantry platoon was highly irritable with much conflict and some fighting, motivation and performance were poor, and morale seemed low. The platoon had suffered a casualty in a firefight during a recon patrol ten days ago. The company commander had immediately conducted an after action review, but the platoon continued to show signs of stress. Assessment The NSMP administered the Unit-IQ survey (see Appendix H and Table 6.4 below) and received 21 anonymous responses from the platoon of 27 service members (see full results, below). To obtain a better understanding of the survey results, he conducted walkabouts and engaged in conversations with platoon members. As expected, survey results (scores range from 0-4) showed high levels of irritability (3.4), combat stressors (3.2), and poor unit morale (3.6). The survey also revealed a previously unknown issue of officer leadership concerns (3.7). Functional impact was high for behavioral health indicators (3.0), combat stressors (3.3), and highest for leadership climate concerns (3.7). Comments on the survey and follow-up conversations with service members demonstrated that unit members believed that their second lieutenant had unfairly blamed them for the casualty and was highly critical of individual service members and the team as a whole. Additionally, the second lieutenant had markedly increased their training time and had restricted their phone time with their families. Table 6.4. Unit-IQ Survey Results.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non-Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 6: Command Consultation 11 Interventions The NSMP briefed the company commander, and they agreed on a number of actions. The commander temporarily relieved Second Lieutenant Green of his responsibilities and referred him for a command consult (see command consult case vignette below). He directed the senior NCO to supervise training, re-instated phone privileges for the platoon, and conducted a stand down to build morale and increase resiliency. Additionally, the chaplain conducted a traumatic event management (TEM) training, and the NSMP facilitated a morale-promoting and team-building exercise. COMMAND CONSULT: PROVIDE COMMAND MONITORING TO ENSURE LEADERSHIP WELLBEING General Introduction to Command Consult and Monitoring Healthy and sound leadership in general and command in particular are critical to mission success and unit wellbeing. Occasionally leaders suffer from stress, fatigue, and other conditions that may compromise their functioning. Medical providers monitor leadership’s wellbeing and functioning to support unit and mission success, regardless of rank and position. Early detection, assessment, and intervention are intended to help those in leadership positions, preserve command climate, improve vertical unit cohesion, and support mission accomplishment. Command monitoring can be a delicate process, as it might be viewed as a challenge to command’s authority that could potentially threaten the mission, and unfortunately, also threaten the commanding officer’s ego. Moreover, commanding officers (COs) hold a unique position of power that can be intimidating to those of lower rank, or cause problems for those under their command who may raise issues that command doesn’t want to hear or address. In consideration of these possible dynamics the NSMP must understand the importance of their command monitoring function, as the safety of the unit and the success of the mission depend on optimal performance by leaders; therefore, they must be confident and stand firm in their role notwithstanding possible difference in rank issues (e.g., the NSMP is of lower rank than the commander). To this end, it is essential that the NSMP has strong, respectful relationships with the chain of command and remains objective and professional. Additional care should be taken if the leader in question is in the NSMP's direct chain of command. These situations can be especially delicate because the leader may see the NSMP's concern as insubordination. NSMPs should consult with other peer professionals familiar with the situation (other medical, chaplain, or helping professionals) within the unit, staff the situation with a NSMP at a higher level in the organization (such as a brigade or wing surgeon), etc. These peer or technical consultations can help the NSMP sort out personal perceptions and opinions from true professional concerns. Monitor, Detect, and Assess Monitor the Health and Well-Being of Commanders and Leaders and Detect Any Issues In order to effectively monitor leaders’ behavioral health status, the NSMP must know the baseline status of all unit leaders and be aware of any changes. As with all monitoring actions, the NSMP can obtain information in multiple ways and from various sources, including general observations, casual conversations, active questioning, concerning reports Leadership climate functional impact 3.7 Total morale/leadership score 3.6 Score Interpretation (range 0-4) and Examples 0-0.9 Little Concern 1.0-1.9 Concern 2.0-2.9 Risk 3.0-4.0 High Risk Not at all-Once/week 1-3 times/week 3-5 times/week 5-7 times/week Not at all-A little bit A little bit-Moderately Moderately-Quite a bit Quite a bit-Extremely Very-Moderate Low Moderately Low-Neutral Neutral-Moderately High Moderately-Very High",

Reperfusion injury may continue for as long as 60 hours after release of the crush injury. • Other consequences of reperfusion include massive third spacing of fluids in crushed tissues, leading to hypovolemia and shock and exacerbating renal injury, and leading to compartment syndrome. Clinical Presentation Clinical signs of crush injury/crush syndrome include some or all of the following: • Skin injury of the affected body part (may be subtle and less impressive than other signs) • Limb swelling (may be delayed) • Paresis or paralysis (may be mistaken as spinal cord injury) • Loss of sensation (may mask the severity of underlying injury) • Pain (typically becomes severe with reperfusion) • Absent or weak extremity pulses • Discolored urine due to myoglobinuria or hematuria or both • Hypotension due to hypovolemia (dehydration, hemorrhage, third spacing of fluids) is commonly present and may be severe • Massive third spacing (often causes or exacerbates compartment syndrome and renal failure) • Metabolic abnormalities (hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis) • Clinical signs of compartment syndrome (severe pain in the involved extremity, pain on passive stretching of the involved muscles, decreased sensation to the affected limb) • Renal failure (due to rhabdomyolysis and secondary myoglobinuric acute tubular necrosis).

Delayed treatment leads to poor outcome. • Most crush syndrome patients have an extensive area of involvement such as a lower extremity and/or the pelvis. It requires more involvement than just one paw. Also, the crushing force must be present for some time before crush injury syndrome can occur. • The syndrome may develop in <1 hour in a severe crush situation, but usually it takes 4 to 6 hours of com­ pression for the processes that cause crush injury syndrome to take place. • The hallmark initial treatment for crush syndrome is IV fluid therapy before release of pressure and contin- Crush Injuries 71",

Furthermore, the nature of their embedded status ensures that technicians are uniquely established to identify patterns of unit needs in order to increase and sustain performance and motivation and promote positive behavioral health. However, a recent report demonstrated inconsistent utilization and underutilization of enlisted behavioral health technicians in garrison,25 to include relegation to administrative and clerical tasks. With appropriate training and adequate oversight, technicians may function semi‐autonomously to conduct such tasks as implementing therapy protocols, conducting group interventions, and maintaining a therapeutic caseload.27 Improved training for technicians must include more accurate recognition of early signs of maladaptive coping in individual service members, increased opportunity to work with service members after the initial triage/assessment, as well as enhanced coping within units. Furthermore, technicians will be more readily utilized at Role 1 treatment facilities if aligned at the battalion (or equivalent) level. CHAPLAINCY Additional resources that are organic to the unit and could be leveraged at roles 1 and 2 include chaplaincy services. A chaplain is more likely to be physically located closer to a deployed/forward location than a behavioral health specialist. Most chaplains are trained in basic counseling and are usually familiar with common behavioral health conditions from having worked closely with behavioral health counselors in prior duty assignments. The broad nature of confidentiality afforded by Chaplains may appeal to personnel who perceive limits of confidentiality as being a deterrent to help seeking. ROLE 2 Care at the Role 2 is rendered by the area support squad and medical treatment platoon of medical companies. The primary goal of Role 2 is to provide “forward resuscitative care.” The Role 2 Military Treatment Facility (MTF) has the capability to provide combat and operational stress control, preventive medicine, and physical therapy services. The Role 2 MTF provides a greater capability than is available at Role 1. Those patients who can return to duty within 72 hours (1 to 3 days) are held for treatment. This role of care provides medical evacuation from supported Role 1 MTFs and also provides Role 1 medical treatment on an area support basis for units without organic Role 1 resources. The primary function of Role 2 is to stabilize and prepare casualties for strategic aeromedical evacuation. Role 2 is the “home base” of uniformed BHOs from which battlefield circulation is derived. Examples of Army and Navy capabilities at Role 2 have been highlighted below. It should be noted that in forward operations, in view of limited availability of resources, services leverage available resources. For example, service members from the Air Force or Navy could avail help at the Army Combat and Operational Stress Control detachment. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OFFICERS As indicated earlier, individual and unit behavioral health promotion will be more readily facilitated through organic unit assets such as self‐aid, buddy aid, medics, and embedded behavioral health technicians. However, in instances where additional support might be needed, rotational support from Role 2 could be leveraged. In these situations, the behavioral health officer/licensed provider role will develop from hands‐on provision of care to that of a clinical, supervisory, and training consultant. In garrison, the behavioral health officer should be providing realistic, experiential training to all troops to include Role 1 medical providers; trainings such as pre‐deployment stress inoculation training have demonstrated positive effects by mitigating the future development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), particularly within the hyperarousal cluster of symptoms.28 In deployed settings, the primary role of the behavioral Chapter 1: Behavioral Health Assets Typically Available in the Deployed Environment 6",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel health officer is to provide supervision and consultation to Role 1 assets, assessing for the implementation fidelity of treatment protocols. ARMY ROLE 2 Combat Operational Stress Control (COSC): The Army COSC detachment has been the primary means for providing behavioral health care in theater since Operation Enduring Freedom.29,30 These COSC clinics exclusively focus on specialty behavioral health care services, often operating independently from other medical services. COSC operates in a “hub and spoke” manner such that the COSC clinic is established at a forward operating base (FOB), and the behavioral health teams travel to other FOBs from their “home base” as part of battlefield circulation.31 COSC clinics utilize traveling teams of behavioral health providers and technicians or telemedicine equipment to reach patients in remote areas. COSCs in some instances might also be co‐located at large, permanent restoration centers at Role 3. Army Brigade Combat Teams: Combat and Operational Stress Control (COSC) support is provided by behavioral health sections assigned to the brigade support medical company of the brigade support battalion. If required, these resources can receive direct support from the behavioral health personnel assigned to the medical detachment (Combat and Stress Control Clinic or Restoration Clinics), if augmentation is required. Organic assets (i.e. providers and paraprofessional technicians) are typically aligned at the brigade/battalion level and provide clinical care to soldiers within their organic units. Typically, organic behavioral health personnel are uniformed, but in certain circumstances may be government civilians or contractors. Personnel live, train, and fight within the units they serve and are generally housed within the unit’s organic behavioral health clinic within one FOB. This allows for BHOs to build rapport with soldiers and effectively assess, treat, and impact individual and organizational needs. Responsibilities include providing consultation and advisement to commanders regarding behavioral health needs and trends at the individual as well as unit level. The behavioral health technicians thus serve a unique role and are a critical asset25 aiding in the recognition of and treatment for maladaptive coping in individual soldiers, such as through the interruption of maladaptive reactions at the point of injury. Furthermore, the nature of their embedded status ensures that technicians are uniquely established to identify patterns of unit needs in order to increase and sustain performance and motivation and promote positive behavioral health. The level of care provided best meets and does not exceed the level of care required in the area of responsibility. The interventions are intended to be brief, time limited, and more resource efficient than specialty behavioral health care. The focus is more on functional impairment and symptom reduction, as compared to specialty care that focuses on pathology, diagnosis, and intervention. Composition of Team: Teams are typically made up of one to two licensed behavioral Health Officer BHOs (social worker and/or psychologist) and two to four 68Xs (behavioral health technicians). They may also rely on COSC and/or COSC resources to supplement/help support their unit, especially when troops are dispersed across wide geographic domain or when availability/accessibility issues arise. Members engage in continuous and predictable battlefield circulation – travelling through the unit area of operations (AO) on a regular basis to access as many soldiers/units as possible. Multi‐ day visits might be scheduled to varied Combat OutPosts (COPs) and FOBs. NAVY ROLE 2 Behavioral health care at this level will be provided through the combined efforts of behavioral health assets embedded within the unit, as well as behavioral health assets assigned to forward medical units. It is not expected that an operational unit’s organic behavioral health asset will always be sufficient to meet the demands of every situation and therefore is expected to be augmented periodically with additional support. The activities at this level include interventions such as behavioral health triage, brief supportive counselling, group intervention, disaster postvention, Chapter 1: Behavioral Health Assets Typically Available in the Deployed Environment 7",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY It is helpful to gather a brief clinical history to understand the person’s context and further clarify their presenting issue and possible causes. Appendix A includes some basic clinical interview questions that cover basic demographics, stress and recent trauma exposure, substance use, violence or suicide history, history of behavioral health, and history of neurological/other medical issues. TECHNIQUES AND INTERVIEW STYLE The manner of asking the questions and responding are as important as the content of the questions. Active listening is an approach to communication that emphasizes the listener’s attempt to understand the speaker’s perceptions of events without making their own interpretations and conclusions. This approach can be helpful to: 1) de‐escalate a person in crisis and 2) get more accurate clinical data. Some specific techniques involve paraphrasing (i.e., attempting to summarize what the person said), reflection (i.e., repeating back what the person said), and clarification (i.e. asking follow‐up questions about specific phrases or comments). In addition, motivational interviewing,12 a style of asking questions and engaging a person to elicit their internal motivation to change, is also a useful framework for conducting an interview. Using this framework is particularly important for agitated or generally untrusting service members who may be resistant to answering questions. It is important to avoid engaging in confrontation as that leads to less information and can further agitate the person. Consider using the acronym OARS:13 • Open Ended Questions: What things do you have on your plate right now? What are you dealing with?” rather than “Do you have stress right now?” • Affirming: “No wonder you feel overwhelmed. That is a lot to manage at home from so far away.” • Reflective Listening: “What I hear you saying is that the argument you had with your squad leader is making it hard to do your job now.” • Summarizing: “Let me see if I’ve got this straight. You’ve not been able to sleep more than two to three hours per night and are still really shaken by the fire fight you were in two weeks ago. On top of that, your medically ill mother is at home and you’re not sure if she will survive until you get back. That is a lot to manage.” SCREENER ADMINISTRATION Consider routinely using behavioral health vital signs screeners. As described in the following minimum, better, and best section, screeners are not considered minimally necessary. Upfront use of the BASIS screener, as it includes questions about general distress and suicide, is considered better and use of all the described screeners is considered best. The measures themselves can also be administered item by item in a conversation with the service member. Alternatively, you might print them out for the service member to complete by hand. Self‐report screeners provide some information about what the presenting issues might be but are not meant to result in diagnosis. The screener results must also be taken into context of the service member’s comprehension of their own symptoms and willingness to honestly report them. Therefore, it is important to follow‐up with the service member on specific, relevant items for clarification and further understanding. For example, a service member responds affirmatively to “I feel hopeless,” then it is helpful to talk further about what that item means to the service member and use active listening skills. See Appendix B for each full screener. Chapter 2: Basic Assessment and Intervention Principles for Forward Behavioral Health Care 3",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 3: Management of Serious Behavioral Health Conditions that may Manifest in Forward Environments 13 SUICIDE RISK: INTERVENTIONS One of the most important aspects of behavioral health triage that medics or peers need to know in forward environments is how to manage acute suicidal thoughts and behaviors. As indicated earlier, suicide risk assessment could serve as a preventive intervention by de‐escalating the risk and helping the service member feel connected with fellow service members. Assess for suicide risk by directly asking suicide assessment questions noted above (e.g., “Are you thinking of harming yourself?” “Are you thinking about ending your life?”). High risk for suicide is indicated if service member indicates plans for acting out on ideation. Table 3.3. Suicide Prevention Intervention Matrix. Level of Risk Management Recommendations Risk Indicators Minimum Better Best Low Acute Risk ‐ Occasional suicidal ideation ‐ No intention to act, no plan or rehearsal of a suicide act ‐ No history of prior attempt ‐ Reflective listening to de‐escalate ‐ Encourage self‐ management through involvement in activities to control stress (e.g., relaxation techniques, journaling, communication) ‐ Address ongoing stressors (e.g., relationship concerns, lack of sleep, thoughts of self‐harm) ‐ Provide reassurance and supportive counselling ‐ Provide resource education/awareness (e.g., ministry or spiritual resources) *For low and high acute risk, in addition to the minimum and better strategies: ‐ Monitor for any changes in symptoms ‐ Provide safety plan combined with unit watch and lethal means safety. The Safety Plan should: 1. Identify signs of a crisis, suicidal ideation, or maladaptive behavior 2. Help with coping strategies for grief, trauma, and stress 3. List people, social settings, or objects that provide distraction from the stressor 4. List people and identify professional resources the service member can contact for help 5. List steps the service member can take to make the environment safe (e.g., reducing lethal accessibility) High Acute Risk ‐ Persistent suicidal thoughts, ideation or intrusive, disruptive thoughts ‐ Strong intention with plan to act on suicidal ideation ‐ Recent suicide attempt ‐ Service member/service member’s unit exposed and impacted by a suicidal event ‐ Means safety, secure access to lethal means such as weapons, medication etc. ‐ Place service member on limited duty ‐ Provide Buddy Aid and consider unit watch QPR strategy : 1. Question: Ask direct questions. C‐SSRS can assist with triage process 2. Persuade: Listen without judgement, show you care, persuade service member to seek help 3. Refer: Do not leave at‐ risk service member alone! After removing lethal means, escort service member to a medic, chaplain, or trusted leader SUICIDE RISK: COMMAND INTERVENTIONS Suicide prevention starts with simple, ongoing efforts to promote psychological health and a sense of community. Commanders can proactively plan for crisis intervention, address the process for identification, actively support referral, and prompt access to care for at‐risk service members, as well as those affected by a suicide. Reports of a service member expressing suicidal ideation, coupled with having a suicide plan, and thoughts of acting on that plan are indicative of high acute risk of suicide. Occasional thoughts without a specific plan or thoughts of acting on the plan are indicative of low acute risk for suicide. Whether the risk is low or high, the safety of the unit and the service member is the responsibility of the Command; below are a few recommended actions to consider.",

Interventions that are better than the minimal approach include managing anger effectively to prevent the release of anger in the form of verbal or physical aggression. Suggested approaches include an initial de‐escalation of the stress by talking to the service member and helping the service member to relax using breathing exercises, followed by help with problem‐solving. The medic or buddy can help by asking clarifying questions and guiding the service member in problem‐solving. A few guiding tips are described below: • Ask what’s happening using open‐ended questions. Example: “What’s upsetting you right now?” • Offer help and re‐orient the person to who you are, who they are, and where you are. Example: “I see you’re angry and maybe scared. I want to help. I am LT Johnson, the PA. We are at FOB XXX. We met before in the DFAC.” • Repeat back to the person what you heard to ensure accurate information and to indicate that you are listening. Example: “I hear you saying that you think that you’re angry at your platoon leader and that he is out to get you. Is that right?” On identifying the issue, help‐with problem solving and resolving the issue by using the following suggestions: • Request/ask politely (do not command). Example: “I would like to talk with you more about this issue. Do you mind if we sit down, grab some water, and I ask follow‐up questions?” • Give reasons for requests and be genuine/honest. • Make an apology or change if necessary. • Make an apology or change if necessary. • Offer choices, help with identifying the triggers of anger and alternate ways of controlling anger. Example: “I hear you saying that your platoon leader wants to speak to me, so I am going to be in trouble? You saw him looking at you and think that he is laughing or thinking something negative about you?” • Be flexible, negotiate, avoid power struggle, and compromise and talk through the issue. • A medic can help challenge the unhelpful thoughts and identify ways in which service member can better cope with the issue ‐‐ for example, helping with clear communication with the platoon leader and being assertive when needed. For service members with a diagnosed behavioral health disorder (e.g., depressive/anxiety disorder or PTSD), the clinician may recommend up to three days of restorative hold. This hold allows for the service member to receive individual or group therapy and medication management (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI)) with the goal of targeting any problematic behavioral health symptom.47 Chapter 4: Management of Most Common Behavioral Health Conditions That May Manifest in Forward Environments 21",

In deployed settings, long work hours, rotating shifts, overnight call frequency, patient ratios, inadequate staffing,26 frequency of surprising or unexpected events such as MASCAL, and high degree of unfinished tasks and missed care due to staffing restrictions and limited resources, impact the behavioral health of the NSMP evidenced by burnout.35-37 ADDITIONAL STRESSORS An inability to participate in decisions that affect the work environment or quality of leadership can also contribute to burnout among NSMPs. This can also occur in a unit climate where there is no recognition achievement, unfair management practices or unclear procedures for allocating rewards or promotion, and a lack of leadership qualities from an inadequate or low-quality supervisor.32-34 Finally, a frequent lack of ability or complete inability to resolve ethical dilemmas, especially during combat or during MASCAL events, has also been cited to impact the behavioral health of NSMP.35-37 Causes related to the professional demands of either military and/or medical professionals that contribute to burnout include working with patients with extreme pain, life-threatening injury or wound, local/national medical needs, air evacuations, traumatic brain, spinal cord or neurologic injury, behavioral health needs, suicide ideation or attempts, death by suicide, mass casualty events, death, futile or catastrophic care, wounded or injured children, triaging medical cases, humanitarian missions, and infectious disease outbreaks.35-37 PERSONAL CAUSES In additional to occupational exposures and stress, several personal causes for burnout have been identified. Indicators include sustained physical or psychological effort without time for recovery coupled with feelings of isolation or lack of support from colleagues;31-34,26,4 feeling underutilized and lacking confidence; not taking care of self, evidenced by skipping meals or breaks, lack of sleep, and having a strong internal drive to prioritize work over other important aspect of life; and an inability to disengage or disconnect from work or working excessive hours repeatedly.31-34,26,4 Military nurses were found to experience more burnout than their civilian counterparts because of the additional professional duties and obligations of military status.12-14",

    "text": " CHAPTER 7 Abdominal Trauma Abdominal Injuries in Deployed MWDs These injuries are the result of either blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) or penetrating abdominal trauma (PAT).1-7 Management of these types of injuries differs markedly. Conservative medical management is usually indicat­ ed for MWDs with blunt abdominal trauma; whereas, urgent exploratory surgery is generally recommended for MWDs with penetrating injuries. A clinical management algorithm for MWDs with abdominal trauma is provided. (See Figure 38). Physical Exam Finding Supporting Abdominal Trauma Suspect significant intra-abdominal injury in any MWD that presents with abdominal rigidity or sensitivity to palpation, increasing abdominal size over time, visible bruising of the abdominal wall, or failure to respond to or deterioration in face of aggressive trauma resuscitation. Wounds involving more than the skin and superfi­ cial subcutaneous tissues dictate detailed examination to determine if the body wall was penetrated, and may require surgical exploration. Diagnosis of Abdominal Trauma The diagnostic method of choice for evaluating patients with suspected blunt abdominal trauma is the abdominal FAST (AFAST) exam, with ultrasound-guided or 4-quadrant needle abdominocentesis if free abdominal fluid is noted. Consider CT if advanced imaging is available. Perform an AFAST exam during the initial evaluation phase of every MWD with a history of trauma, acute col­ lapse, or weakness. FAST is proven in dogs to be extremely reliable in detecting free abdominal fluid and can be performed rapidly during resuscitation.8 • Examine 4 quadrants. Probe placement for dogs includes the diaphragmatic-hepatic site (DH) caudal to the liver, the splenorenal site (SR) around the left kidney, the cystocolic site (CC) cranial to the urinary bladder, and the hepatorenal site (HR) around the right kidney.8 Figure 39 on page 51 provides a schematic showing probe placement in dogs.

    "text": "  CHAPTER 17 Traumatic Brain Injury and Acute Spinal Cord Injury Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acute spinal cord injury (ASCI) are uncommon in MWDs. These injuries are often catastrophic, with poor long-term outcome. Caring for affected MWDs is daunting and can tax resources. However, some CNS injuries are recoverable, so efforts to evaluate MWDs with TBI and ASCI should be made to determine the severity of injury and potential for successful outcome. Anticipate these injuries in MWDs exposed to building collapses, blast, and ballistics injuries. Acute Spinal Cord Injury Assume ASCI is present in every MWD trauma patient until proven it is not present. Maintain a high index of suspicion! 40-50% of MWDs with ASCI have concurrent injury elsewhere that may be more life-threatening.1 Focus on initial resuscitation and stabilization, but constantly consider potential neurological injuries. Excessive movement can cause a partial injury to become a permanent injury. Limit movement during the initial exam and treatment period to that which is absolutely necessary until a detailed neurological exam is performed. Clinical Signs Suggesting ASCI Clinical findings of bruising over any part of the spine; spinal instability, misalignment, crepitus or pain along the spine; presence of head injury or altered mentation or level of consciousness; or major trauma to other body systems are early tips that ASCI may be present. Specific neurological signs that strongly suggest ASCI include loss of conscious proprioception, loss of superfi­ cial and deep pain, and loss of function (paresis or paralysis). Lesion Localization It is ideal to localize the segment of the cord affected. Determine if upper motor neuron (UMN) or lower motor neuron (LMN) signs are present. • UMN signs are characterized by increased motor tone causing normal or exaggerated limb reflexes, normal to increased muscle tone, and decreased proprioception and decreased superficial and deep pain sensa­ tion in areas caudal to the lesion. • LMN signs are characterized by flaccid or weak motor tone causing depressed limb reflexes and decreased muscle tone in areas caudal to the lesion.

    "text": "JTS CPG Author Guidance ID:100 2 INTRODUCTION The Joint Trauma System (JTS) and the DoD Trauma System are grateful for authors to take on the responsibility of either updating or authoring a Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG). This is huge undertaking that requires a lot of coordination, communication, and iteration. The CPG management team, which includes nurses, physicians and the JTS Chief, will assist and be involved with the process. The first author of the CPG will have the biggest responsibility and, along with the JTS Chief, will be the guarantor of the work. This document on author guidance is meant to serve as a roadmap for first authors and the author team. Like all CPGs, it is meant as a guideline, and individual CPGs will vary according to the specific clinical problem they are addressing. JTS CPGs are intended primarily for the deployed and expeditionary environments, but much of the evidence and best practices come from civilian care. JTS CPGs are peer reviewed by a CPG team of physicians. RESPONSIBILITIES FOR NEW OR UPDATED CPGS JTS RESPONSIBILITIES The following list outlines the responsibilities of the JTS during the CPG creation process. 1. Identify and communicate with ﬁrst author and other lead authors. Ensure ﬁrst author has the appropriate credentials to be the lead author. Such credentials include experience with the topic, and ideally operational and/or deployed experience when appropriate. 2. Adjudicate the author list to ensure it represents the Services. 3. For CPGs requiring an update, reach out to previous CPG authors and determine whether they desire to lead or contribute to the update. 4. Gather and invite civilian leaders/authorities on the topic and ensure that they are in communication with the ﬁrst author and know their responsibility as a Subject Matter Expert (SME). 5.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel ECHELONS OF CARE IN THE DEPLOYED ENVIRONMENT The triage process (described here and expanded in detail in Chapters 2 – 4) for COSC is used to sort service members depending upon the symptoms/needs, capabilities available, and location where they can best be managed. The COSC management principles are expressed in the memory aid—Brevity, Immediacy, Contact, Expectancy, Proximity, and Simplicity (BICEPS), and described more in Chapter 2. These principles apply to all COSC interventions or activities throughout the theater and are adhered to by COSC personnel in all behavioral health and COSC elements. These principles may be applied differently based on a particular role of care and other factors pertaining to mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations. This is accomplished by a proactive preventive medicine program and a phased health care system (levels of care) that extends from actions taken at the point of injury or illness to evacuation from theater for treatment at an appropriate facility. The primary objective of embedded and forward deployed behavioral health assets is to make behavioral health care available at the point of need in order to conserve the fighting strength of the military. Each service’s behavioral health team has a distinctive composition and capability which is task organized to meet the needs of its mission. Therefore, this chapter applies a common framework for comparison in order to offer value in describing best practices. Embedded and deployed behavioral health forces do not always fit cleanly into the Health Service Support (HSS) model of Role 1 (battalion aid stations), Role 2 (limited field hospital), and Role 3 (combat support hospital). Nonetheless, it is a useful framework to describe the roles and capabilities which are available in an operational environment. A basic characteristic of organizing and planning for HHS support is the distribution of medical resources and capabilities to facilities at various levels of command, diverse locations, and progressive capabilities, referred to as roles of care. For medical planners to effectively provide mission support to the commander, they need to understand the full breadth of these roles of medical care. Different levels denote differences in capability, rather than the quality of care. Each level has the capability of the level before it and expands on that capability, with level 4 referring to care in a fixed facility outside the forward environment. Given that the focus of this guidance is on far‐ forward capability, description of assets in this chapter is limited to Roles 1 to Role 3. Additionally, it should be noted that the capabilities at each level in a forward operation can be joint. For example, support provided at a Role 3 hospital could include an Army Division psychiatrist, a Navy or Air Force behavioral hospital team, and a combat stress control restoration center. Thus, service members can leverage tri‐service assets. Table 1.1 provides a snapshot of behavioral health assets and capabilities across services in forward environment. Table 1.1.

Potential levels of support available in austere environments are depicted in the figure below. Level 1, the fastest and most frequently readily available resource, focuses on unit member and leader actions. Given that ministry or chaplains also deploy with service members, this is an additional capability that could be leveraged. This support involves self‐ help, buddy help, support from unit ministry as well as leader actions. Level 2 interventions involve more formal actions that may be carried out by trained peers and/or in consultation with trained behavioral health professionals (e.g., behavioral health technicians). Finally, Level 3 interventions, the capability of which might be rather limited in far‐ forward environments, but important for command to consider as additional tools in maintaining unit readiness, include treatment by specialty behavioral health providers. Figure 1.1. Role 1: First Aid/Emergency Medical Care and First Responder Capability Level 3 Treatment by Psychological Support Professionals/Tele Behavioral Health Level 2 Consultation with Psychological Support Professionals and Trained Peers (e.g., Behavioral Health Technicians, COSC rotational support) Level 1 Self‐ and Buddy‐Aid, Chaplaincy and Unit Ministry Support, Military Leader Actions The definition of Role 1 care is broad. Role 1 for all services begins with some form of self‐aid or leadership intervention. Command involvement through good leadership and fostering a supportive environment is crucial to mitigating stress in austere environments. This merits a more elaborate discussion and has been captured in detail in Chapter 6. Self‐Aid or Buddy Aid includes multiple aspects of battlefield care from basic first aid performed by all combatants to medical care provided at the battalion aid station (BAS). Behavioral health capabilities are provided by self and peers as well as by the combat lifesaver. Self‐Aid and Buddy Aid are interventions delivered by service member to either self or buddy during instances of crisis, such as acute stress reactions and panic attacks.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel OVERVIEW: FAR FORWARD INTERVENTIONS As stated above, most effective interventions are non‐specific and center on modifying stress. Experiencing stress that exceeds a person’s resources exacerbates any pre‐existing behavioral health condition and often can trigger an apparent behavioral health issue. There are times when medical evacuation is necessary; it is important to balance a consideration for the negative impact of removing the service member from their unit and their role as this transition can further exacerbate behavioral health issues. Interventions should follow a stepped approach as much as possible to ensure the lowest appropriate level intervention for the presenting issue. First, elements of a service member’s organic leadership should play an integral role in monitoring for changes from their baseline behavior and ensure that further assessment and treatment is sought when necessary. Second, interventions applied in theater should be brief and focused on skills learned prior to deployment as well as common presenting issues in a deployed setting. Finally, a thorough understanding of when presenting symptoms require a higher level of care is needed to avoid unnecessary burden on the already limited capacity to provide care in a forward deployed setting. Chapters 3 and 4 outline a framework for forward intervention that draws on prolonged field care principles. Utilizing this “minimum,” “better,” “best” framework to focus on the most common and most serious behavioral health conditions that emerge in far‐forward environments provides NSMPs a range of potential options to intervene when specialty care is not available. CONSIDERATIONS FOR PRE‐EXISTING CONDITIONS The overarching goal of providing behavioral health treatment in theater is to keep service members in the fight and maintaining unit readiness for the duration of the deployment period. In accomplishing this goal with limited resources and often in austere environments, it is vital that interventions be brief and focused on high yield treatment goals. Treatment planning and intervention in a forward operating environment can be approached along the same lines of symptom evaluation, where prior history (e.g., interventions that the service member had undergone prior to deployment) is considered along with the direct impact of deployment. First, service members with an existing diagnosis were likely receiving behavioral health services prior to deployment and have likely developed skills over the course of therapy in garrison. In some cases, they may have developed something resembling a crisis plan or skills toolbox with coping strategies tailored for the deployed environment. If they have not worked with their previous provider on this issue, it may be a useful starting point. In addition to leveraging previously developed skills, education and intervention targeted at problems commonly faced during deployment – including sleep related issues, lack of adequate self‐care, and education about normal stress responses – provide additional targets for intervention that may be implemented by non‐medical personnel. Second, when considering how to implement treatments it is important not only to make note of which resources are available now (see Chapter 1), but perhaps more importantly, what is the lowest level from which these interventions can be implemented? In some cases, treatment may be self‐administered by the service member with or without intermittent monitoring by a peer, unit leadership, a member of a combat stress operational control team, or a medical or behavioral health provider. It should also be noted that 40% of service members receiving a treatment plan in theater were prescribed medication, with 75% of those receiving antidepressant medication,31 although availability of psychotropic prescription medications in the far‐ forward theater remains uncertain. Finally, it has been found that providers considered or recommended medical evacuation for approximately 4% of all service members presenting with behavioral health issues.31 While relatively infrequent, it is vital to understand the medical capabilities as well as the medical evacuation chain within the deployed setting (see Chapter 7).

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 3: Management of Serious Behavioral Health Conditions that may Manifest in Forward Environments 2 ASSESSMENT AND TRIAGE OF ACUTE AGITATION Agitation is typically a change in behavior that is associated with an underlying medical or psychiatric condition. Acute agitation in forward combat environments requires immediate intervention. Agitation, as defined by the 1st International Experts’ Meeting on Agitation,3 includes:  Inability to stay calm or still.  Motor or verbal hyperactivity.  Emotional tension.  Difficulties in communication. Agitation presents clear immediate safety issues in addition to conveying potential medical issues that require immediate intervention. Agitation includes nonspecific, unrelated behaviors and the “feeling of irritability or severe restlessness” with a fluctuating course.4 Agitation is a symptom that is associated with both medical (generalized infection, exposure to toxins, electrolyte abnormalities, traumatic brain injury (TBI), etc.) as well as behavioral conditions (drug/alcohol intoxication or withdrawal, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, etc.).4 Management of agitation thus necessitates assessment of presenting symptoms and evaluation of underlying causes. For example, the Joint Trauma System Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Traumatic Brain Injury Management in Prolonged Field Care indicates that the most common signs of patients with non‐convulsive seizures include agitation and or blank stare.5 The following table (Table 3.1) describes factors, need for medical intervention, and differential diagnoses associated with agitation.6,7 Table 3.1. Differential Diagnoses Associated with Agitation. MANAGEMENT OF AGITATION & ACUTE SAFETY ISSUES Though medication interventions may differ across presenting issues, behavioral strategies for management of safety issues related to agitation and distress may be very similar across diverse underlying conditions. The primary initial approach is to ensure safety of surroundings, verbally de‐escalate, and leaving the patient in a quiet, unlocked room (if feasible).6 Treatment approaches should ensure the safety of the patient, staff and all others in the area, help stabilize the patient, avoid restraints when at all possible, and avoid coercive interventions that will probably escalate the agitation.6 Minimum:  Consult and coordinate with Command to remove the service member’s weapon. Ideally, the service member would voluntarily hand over their weapon.  “I see that you’re upset. It’s our policy here to place your weapon on the rack when you walk in. Will you place it over there?” Possible Contributing Factors & Differential Diagnoses Possible Medical Origins  Abnormal vital signs  Focal neurologic findings  Evidence of head injury  Substance intoxication  Substance withdrawal  Exposure to toxins or drugs  Decreased awareness with attentional problems  Acute Psychotic Episode  Alcohol or drugs (e.g., opioids, amphetamines, cannabis)  Prescription meds (benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, opioids etc.)  Head trauma  Delirium  Electrolyte disturbance  Hypoxia  Seizure/postictal state  Environmental toxicity",

Good self‐care is comprised of adaptive coping and includes the 5 Rs: Reassurance of normality, Rest, Replenishment of bodily needs, Restoration of confidence, and help with Return to duty. Initial evaluation as indicated for other behavioral health symptoms should include assessment of risk to service member and unit. Additionally, medic check is recommended for prior episodes of depression and details of medication adherence. If there are indicators of risk to self and expressions of suicidal ideation, peer or medic should ensure that all lethal means are secured and follow the guidance provided for suicidality in Chapter 3. In the absence of suicidal ideation and/or low suicidal risk level, minimum interventions include: 1. providing support and listening to the concerns of the service member. 2. encouraging the service member to rest. 3. allowing time for uninterrupted sleep far from enemy contact. 4. reassuring the service member that there is support and help for the problem situation, and, if applicable. 5. working with command to enable modifications to duties to ensure rest and restoration for the service member. Self‐help skills also can be used, such as tactical breathing, relaxation exercises, and apps such as Breathe2Relax. Reflective listening described below will help with problem‐solving the issue. • Appreciate MAJ Morales for his contribution to the unit and indicate that you notice that he is currently looking upset. Follow‐up by asking what is happening using open‐ended questions. Example: “I see that you are angry and maybe sad after talking to your wife.” • Repeat back to the person what you heard to ensure accurate information and indicate that you are listening. Example: “I hear you saying that you think that you’re angry at your wife and you think that she is out to get you. Is that right?” The next step involves helping with problem‐solving by challenging the negative thoughts. This could be accomplished by the following: • Request/ask politely (do not command). Example: “I would like to talk with you more about this issue. Do you mind if we sit down, grab some water, and I ask follow‐up questions? Why do you think your wife is out to get you?” Better: Behavioral Activation Behavioral management of depression methods that are better than the minimum interventions include practicing self‐ care, buddy care, and behavioral activation. Behavioral activation is a brief psychosocial approach to managing depressive thoughts and behaviors. It is based on the premise that problems in the service members’ lives and behavioral responses reduce the ability to experience positive reward from their environment. The steps in behavioral activation help to systematically increase activation and enable greater contact with sources of reward, as well as problem‐solve issues that the service member might be experiencing. Behavioral activation could be used to help a service member understand how behaviors influence emotions and connect the dots between thoughts and emotions. Monitoring daily activities to increase an understanding of the relationship between the thoughts and actions linked to depression is one of the steps of behavioral activation. Specific techniques of behavioral activation include: 1. Self‐monitoring of activities and mood. Example: Continuing with the case vignette provided earlier, MAJ Morales could be encouraged to maintain a record of activities and changes in mood. The service member can be encouraged to keep a diary of daily activities and events that trigger changes in mood, identify goals and values, build an upward spiral of motivation and energy, problem solve potential barriers to activation such as avoiding stressful situation.

Check what I could do to help with the situation.” “Was the irritation reasonable and due to a task that you were unable to complete? What were barriers to you not being able to keep up with what you had promised to do? Were you multitasking? Can you get help, perhaps talk to your siblings for help with the task?” • To sum up, the best intervention in remote austere settings uses: • Self‐help combined with buddy aid. • Active listening. • Tips to problem‐solve. • Leveraging of command level resources. • Consultation with behavioral health experts, when possible, either synchronously or asynchronously. Elevated Risk Considerations If a service member’s depression worsens to the point of affecting a service member’s occupational performance or if their suicide risk level worsens to the point of becoming an acute, high risk for self‐harm, then the forward deployed medical asset should strongly consider evacuation from theater. The first‐line treatment for even uncomplicated, mild to moderate depression includes evidence‐based psychotherapies ‐‐ e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and interpersonal therapy (IPT) ‐‐ and/or evidence‐based pharmacotherapy (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) delivered by a qualified and appropriately privileged behavioral health specialist. As such, a service member’s depression that has worsened after a robust trial of the various self‐care and problem‐ and emotion‐focused interventions mentioned above will likely require a higher level of care that can only be delivered at a higher role of care (i.e. Role 3 or higher).

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non-Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 6: Command Consultation 12 received from unit members and leaders, or changes in mood, behavior, or performance. The NSMP should exercise discretion in the collection of information. When the NSMP suspects behavioral health concerns in leaders and desires additional information, they may confidentially approach other senior leaders and the chaplain for their insights and observations. Determine Best Way to Further Assess or Address a Concerning Situation Typically, the NSMP would work most closely with the company or squadron commander in regard to behavioral health concerns with individual service members or the unit. For a command consult, if the affected leader is ranked below the commander, the NSMP may proceed with command consultation steps outlined above for individual service members and collaborate with the commander throughout the process, as is customary. However, if it is the company or squadron commander who demonstrates concerning changes, the NSMP must proceed differently and more carefully, as they can no longer consult and collaborate with that individual, but must consult with their superior, the battalion or group/wing commanding officer. Similarly, if the battalion or group/wing commanding officer demonstrates concerning changes, the NSMP must consult with their superior, who may operate outside of the area of operation. If the leader in question is in the NSMP's direct chain of command, prior to briefing/consulting the leader's commanding officer, it is best to pre-brief that officer's main medical advisor to garner their concurrence and support. If possible, that individual should also attend the briefing/consultation with that higher-level commander. Usually, in order to maintain proper order and discipline, the higher-level commander and the medical advisor will take over further assessment and intervention at that point. However, this depends on the situation, the environment, time, and resources available. When concerns are identified, the NSMP and the affected leader’s commanding officer will discuss the situation and agree on the best way to proceed with addressing or further assessing the leader. If needed, the NSMP should consult with the tele-behavioral health provider at this point and share those recommendations with command. Assess Behavioral Health and Well-Being of Commanders and Leaders A strong, respectful relationship between NSMP and command is critical and may be leveraged for further assessment and intervention. In many cases, the NSMP can initiate a conversation with command, expressing their concerns, sharing their observations, and asking questions to obtain further information. If needed, the NSMP can refer to the clinical assessment guidelines and behavioral health screening tools for the NSMP described in Chapters 2-4. However, if command is not receptive or responsive to the NSMP’s questions, the NSMP should discuss their concerns with the individual’s commanding officer and consult with the tele-behavioral health provider to obtain guidance on assessment options. If not contraindicated, the NSMP should speak with other senior leaders and the chaplain for additional information regarding the commander’s behavioral health status and its impact on the unit and mission. Due to the sensitive issues involved and the possible impact on the mission, the commanding officer will determine if the NSMP conducts a behavioral health evaluation with the leader in question, or if the commanding officer takes other actions to address the situation, such as mentoring the leader or coordinating resources with the medical team. If the NSMP proceeds to evaluate the leader, they will ensure the interview is voluntary, adhere to confidentiality mandates, and follow other procedures described in the individual service member consult. If toxic leadership concerns are suspected that may be affecting unit morale and performance, the NSMP may administer relevant items to unit members from the anonymous Unit Survey – Individual Questions (Unit-IQ; Appendix H), particularly Section III – Unit Climate and Leadership Concerns, and gather survey data regarding unit concerns. If indicated, this could be followed up by walkabout voluntary interviews with service members and synthesized with the information previously gathered from the chaplain, other senior leaders, and medical personnel. If needed, the NSMP should consult with the tele-behavioral health provider for interpretation of the survey results and interview findings. Analyze Potential Interventions and Develop Actionable Recommendations The intervention plan will depend on several factors, including the nature of the concerning issues (e.g., simple, straightforward and situationally dependent, vs. complex and more long-standing), the attitude and receptivity of the leader with concerning issues, the rank and duties of the identified leader, the operational status of the mission, the",

Rehearsal: Engaging all stakeholders to analyze and plan for the mission and choreograph a shared response which is flexible to match unique events would help in preventing chaos and facilitating coordinated care. Mnemonic MASCAL expanded as Minimize chaos (remain calm and confident), Assess (perform screening and triage described in Chapter 2), Safety (ensure safety of both affected individuals as well as taking care of self), Communication (communicate with command, peers, and affected individuals in a clear and concise manner), Alert (be on the alert for more casualties, reconstitute, and resupply; watch out for warning signs of behavioral distress in fellow service members and NSMPs) and Lost (do not lose patients or staff; maintain accountability for staff and tracking system for patients) is a useful guide in understanding the principles of management during MASCAL.13 3. Response: As indicated earlier, successful response depends on a prepared team that is familiar with available resources, a MASCAL plan that has been well rehearsed, and service members who can communicate effectively. It is recommended that key personnel who would be providing care have close proximity to the area of operations to help with accelerated response times. Organic resources like chaplains are an invaluable asset for the response team, especially to help with managing behavioral as well as spiritual concerns during MASCAL event. A chaplain is more likely to be physically located closer to a deployed/forward location than a behavioral health specialist. Most chaplains are trained in basic counseling and are usually familiar with common behavioral health conditions based on working closely with behavioral health counselors in prior duty assignments. Chaplains have the additional benefit of complete confidentiality, which makes this a less stigmatizing resource than traditional behavioral health. Senior members of the chain of command are better positioned to facilitate home front communication as the operational mission allows and within the constraints of available technology. These deployed resources may be able reach back and mobilize garrison resources to assist the service member’s loved ones. Behavioral health casualties during MCIs can significantly disrupt the functioning of the NSMP team by diverting resources from physically or critically injured service members. A MASCAL plan that incorporates disruptive behavioral health individual in the practice sessions will help the team to be prepared for such emergencies. Additionally, it should be remembered that members of the unit who bring in their battle buddies for care might very likely be unaware of their injuries due to the adrenaline of battle. Care NSMPs need to watch out for the warning signs and follow guidelines as indicated in Chapters 3 and 4. Having a designated behavioral health professional such as a behavioral health technician, if available, as part of the standard MASCAL response is recommended. 4 and 5. Route and Rest: Given the potential for large number of casualties in a MASCAL event, another crucial element in management of behavioral health concerns includes accountability and transport. Patient transfer guidance and associated considerations has been described in Chapter 7. However, having dedicated staff to meticulously record every patient’s movement from the triage and treatment areas during MASCAL events would help with mitigating confusion and losing track of personnel or patients downrange. Additionally, a unit commander or supervisor needs to be informed on any movement of military or contract personnel. Finally, caring for the service NSMPs, especially during the reset phase when the emergency situation has ceased and the impact of the event is felt by the NSMPs, is crucial and essential. Some of the frequent or common responses include inappropriate outbursts of anger, sleep disturbance, and symptoms of depression.",

For suspect lumbosacral disease, the bone algorithm of 1.25 mm slice thickness should be replaced with 0.625 mm (or equivalent) slice thickness to better visualize the neuroforamina at the lumbosacral junction. Sagittal and dorsal reconstructions of bone and standard algorithms are required. CT Thorax Anesthesia and breath holds are required. Patient should be positioned in ventral recumbency. Study should extend from thoracic inlet through caudal aspect of liver (ensure extent of all lungs imaged). Bone, standard, and lung algorithms should be performed with slice thicknesses at 5.0 mm, 2.5 mm, and 1.25-2.5 mm, respec­ tively. Sagittal and dorsal reconstructions of lung and standard algorithms are required. CT Abdomen Anesthesia and breath holds are required. Patient should be positioned in dorsal recumbency. Study should extend from caudal margin of cardiac silhouette through pelvic canal (or prostate if male). Bone and standard algorithms should be performed with slice thicknesses at 5.0 mm and 2.5 mm, respectively. Sagittal and dorsal reconstructions of bone and standard algorithms are required. CT of Extremity or Joint Patient positioning depends on whether imaging forelimbs or hindlimbs. For forelimbs, the patient is in ventral recumbency. The forelimbs should be extended cranially, resting the forearms and paws on the table with the elbows and shoulders bent at a normal resting position. If the hindlimbs are the focus of the study, the patient is usually placed in dorsal recumbency. The hindlimbs should be placed in maximal caudal extension, keeping both limbs symmetric and including both in the study for comparison purposes (use tape, sponges, or other Diagnostic Imaging 104",

These providers may work as part of a team where providers are paired with behavioral health technicians or may be individually assigned within a unit. The OSCAR program. The OSCAR program was designed to bridge the cultural gap between warfighters and behavioral health professionals by drawing care providers as fully as possible into the culture and life of the Marine units they supported—making them members of the “family” rather than outsiders. OSCAR capabilities have been extended down to the infantry battalion and company levels, without requiring additional behavioral health resources, by providing special OSCAR team training to existing medical and religious ministry personnel (OSCAR extenders) as well as selected enlisted warfighters (OSCAR mentors).32 As special staff officers, OSCAR providers are able to evaluate and advice on the behavioral health well‐being of individuals and units while also being able to provide preventive care. These OSCAR providers are organic to the unit and thus are assigned so that they fall under the direct command of the unit that they are serving. In their primary role as special staff officer,32 the OSCAR provider is expected to spend a significant amount of their time providing support services and consultation to command level leadership designed to improve the command’s behavioral health readiness and safety. Responsibilities include being present at and participating in all command and staff meetings, Force Preservation Councils, as well as providing unit behavioral health surveillance, serving as command liaison, providing preventive behavioral health and resiliency training, and coordinating with external behavioral health services. In addition, the OSCAR providers are expected to fully immerse themselves in the culture of the Marine units including participating in unit‐level training, pre‐deployment exercises, and pre‐ and post‐deployment briefings. As part of their role, the OSCAR provider is expected to provide behavioral health services in forward‐deployed operational environments where services would otherwise be unavailable. ROLE 3 The mission of deployment behavioral health care is to optimize war fighters and keep them in the fight. Medical evacuation from theater to Role 3 or above is utilized for personnel who are at serious risk of harm to self or others, or are otherwise not mentally fit for their area of responsibility. In Role 3, a service member is treated at large, fixed facilities with direct support from division psychiatrists. Services include short‐term psychiatric medical hold capabilities. For the Army and Air Force, these are often co‐located with restoration clinics staffed by combat stress control (CSC) detachment personnel. RESTORATION CENTERS Restoration centers, which are typically short‐term advanced COSC care facilities, are generally co‐located with Role 3 facilities. Services provided at the restoration centers are similar to a community behavioral health model and provide service members with the 4 Rs (Rest, Reassure, Replenish, Restore).33 The primary mission of these centers is to promote individual and unit readiness by enhancing adaptive stress reactions, preventing maladaptive stress reactions, and providing higher level care for combat and operational stress reactions as well as other behavioral health disorders. They are doctrinally structured and provide multi‐day (typically three days to two weeks) programs of education/monitoring/supervision/treatment with the focus on increasing return to duty rates for combat‐stress‐related casualties.34 Examples of referrals to the restoration centers include service members experiencing deployment‐related issues resulting from combat, conflicts with their chain of command, duty assignments, or other adjustment issues. Treatment framework is organized around three components: sleep hygiene, temporary separation from service member unit, and psychoeducational individual or group therapy sessions.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel General Considerations for Telehealth in Operational Environments: The overarching principle of virtual health in an operational setting is that the interaction is always in a consultative posture. Some of the general principles that need to be understood when utilizing reach back capabilities are listed below: • Virtual health in the operational environment should always be arranged with the medical assets on the ground and never directly with the patient. • Unit providers are ultimately responsible for the care of the service member in their area of operations, and need to: • Be familiar with what medical care is available in the area of operations • Know what other circumstances need to be considered that may affect the patients care • Understand the logistics of evacuation out of the geographical area when necessary (see Chapter 7 for medevac considerations) Recent innovations in battlefield telehealth have allowed for more robust communication between and across various echelons of care in Garrison settings. With extended conflicts and engagements, including Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), deployment behavioral health care has expanded and been positively received.34,35 However, there is less empirical support of particular models of care in a deployed environment. Additionally, access to this resource might be limited in far‐forward settings where technology and connectivity might be a challenge. The Services have initiated expansion of tele‐behavioral health capability in forward environments. Exemplars of recent initiatives that have shown promise are showcased below. While approaches such as the Pacific Asynchronous TeleHealth (PATH) system36 serves users widely throughout the fleet as well as shore‐side duty stations in Central and South America, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific, models like the Advanced Virtual Support for Operational Forces (ADVISOR) are still in pilot phase37 and are not available for all far‐forward environments. Given the nascent nature of this capability, the provider is encouraged to explore and rely on available organic assets before engaging or resorting to telehealth service options. EXAMPLES OF TELEHEALTH CAPABILITIES Evaluation and treatment of behavioral issues of service members in the operational environment are initially provided by organic assets described earlier. Additional counseling assets that include military family life counselors (MFLC) can be reached at FOBS such as Camp Aachen, Powidz, and Poznan, to name a few. Referral and/or consultation for behavioral health emergencies and/or evacuations should be coordinated with an organic BHO. If a BHO is not available, then coordination should be made with the division surgeon (DIV SURG) or equivalent regarding how to proceed (Chapter 7). In instances where the operational environment does not possess sufficient behavioral health assets to fully support the service member under the area of responsibility, tele‐behavioral health options need to be considered. The options include virtual deployment of behavioral health teams to address acute issues, provide 2nd level operational and technical support to the austere providers, or provide coaching and mentorship to the team in the austere setting. An Alternatives to telephone consult that has been gaining traction include the Pacific Asynchronous Tele Health (PATH) system. Some additional tele‐behavioral health models that can be leveraged are detailed below. Asynchronous telehealth such as those offered by Health Experts online Portal (HELP) or PATH enables discussion between multiple consultants and the primary care provider, who fittingly remains at the center of medical decision‐making. In this way, the platform is a 21st century workaround to the challenges faced by the military in the form of wide geographic fragmentation and limited specialist availability.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 3: Management of Serious Behavioral Health Conditions that may Manifest in Forward Environments 12 SUICIDE RISK: ASSESSMENT When it is suspected that a service member might be having suicidal thoughts or is contemplating suicide, one of the immediate responses should be a risk assessment. There are several purposes for suicide risk assessment: It provides information on current risk, it allows for monitoring of risk over time, and it facilitates de‐escalation of risk by having the service member feel socially connected and talk about options for care, thus serving as a type of preventive intervention. There exists a misperception that asking someone about suicide will increase the chances of or directly lead to their attempting suicide; however, the research has not supported this concern and even shown that disclosure has positive benefits.30 Suicide‐related thoughts (suicidal ideation or thoughts of killing oneself), behaviors (planning, self‐harm with intent to die), and self‐harm (harming self to regain emotional control/provide emotional release) are often associated with a diagnosis of depression, and it is one of the symptoms included under the criteria for a major depressive episode. However, it is important to note that many factors contribute to suicide (e.g., relationship problems, current crisis, alcohol and substance use, physical health problems, job/financial problems, legal issues), including in those individuals without a known behavioral health condition.28,29 Research indicates that suicide risk is higher when service members are experiencing multiple stressors (e.g., transitions, relationship concerns and career or personal setbacks). In assessing for suicide, several factors should be taken into consideration to better understand the service member’s current mindset and functioning, inform communication to relevant personnel, and aid in decision making regarding intervention, treatment, or any further disposition. At a minimum, a basic assessment should evaluate for current suicidal thoughts/ideation, suicide‐related plans or preparations, any stated intent to die, and history of past suicide attempts. Although it can be difficult to predict who will die by suicide, a prior history of a suicide attempt has been found to be a strong predictor.31,32 It may also be beneficial to assess protective factors, such as family members, community ties, or religious beliefs that would prevent them from harming themselves. Typically, a thorough assessment of suicidality requires a skilled, trained behavioral health provider to accurately assess the relevant factors noted above. However, in far‐forward environments, this may not be feasible and may necessitate a more streamlined assessment. There are several screening tools that have been developed to assess suicidal thoughts, intent, and behavior including the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C‐SSRS), Patient Safety Screener (PSS‐3), Ask Suicide Screening Questions (ASQ).33‐36 The C‐SSRS consists of six questions with affirmative response to suicidal ideation, plan, and acting on the plan indicate a high risk for suicide. Table 3.2. C‐SSRS Questions. Thought/Behavior Past week 1. Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up? Yes/No 2. Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Yes/No If YES to 2, answer questions 3, 4, 5 and 6. If No to 2, go directly to question 6 3. Have you thought about how you might do this? Yes/No 4. Have you had any intention of acting on those thoughts of killing yourself, as opposed to you have thoughts but you definitely would not act on them? High Risk 5. Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? High Risk Always Ask Question 6 6. Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Examples: Collected pills, obtained a gun, gave away valuables, wrote a will or suicide note, held a gun but changed your mind, etc. High Risk",

Instead, it provides a rapid procedure for 1) prompting NSMP to consider at least five empirically supported risk factors; 2) guiding NSMP to investigate individual or combinations of risk factors in greater detail to gauge level of clinical concern; 3) identifying SMs who may be at high risk of violence; 4) prioritizing referrals for a comprehensive violence risk assessment; and 5) assessing needs and dynamic factors to develop a plan to reduce risk. The VIO‐SCAN should neither be used alone nor replace fully informed clinical decision making that investigates risk and protective factors beyond the five items in the screen. The screen does not designate whether a service member is at low, medium, or high risk. Rather, the VIO‐SCAN can structure a part of the evaluation of longer‐term violence risk, not imminent danger. The screen does not have perfect accuracy, so false negatives and false positives will occur. A service member with a score of 5 may never be violent, and one with a score of 0 may be violent. Please note that the VIOSCAN needs to be replicated in other samples by other researchers and may be modified in the future as new research emerges. Interpreting scores A. Individual items: A score of one should prompt follow up questions about this risk factor. For example, if a service member endorses a history of violence, the NSMP should ask about the type, severity, frequency of violence. B. Multiple items: Combinations of endorsed risk factors should be examined. C. Total score: Higher total scores generally indicate a higher probability of problem with violence. A service member with a high score may be a good candidate for a comprehensive risk assessment. However, take into consideration individual items (e.g., if a service member scores a 1 due to recent severe violence, a full assessment is warranted despite the low total score). HOMICIDE RISK: INTERVENTIONS As mentioned previously, the level of risk will dictate the most appropriate level of intervention. Furthermore, the recommendations or strategy should be structured to deter or mitigate the potential for disruptive behavior, with the ultimate goal of prevention. The prevention strategy should integrate organizational, social, psychological, physical, and technical methods to positively influence the SMs behavior, enhance potential victims’ security posture and establish relationships that may encourage early reporting of change in SMs behavior as well as plan for precipitating events.37 Hence, the following recommendations will be separated into high and low risk interventions. However, irrespective of level of risk, appropriate consultation with command should occur, along with notification of the potential victim when feasible.  If the level of risk is low: Occasional homicidal ideation, with no intention to act on the ideation, along with not having a plan or rehearsal of the homicidal act and having no prior history of violence. Address with the service member the underlying stressors contributing to the service member’s current crisis. Provide ongoing support and monitoring. Engage the service member with additional support (i.e. chaplain) opportunities to more frequently engage with their primary support system. Engage the service member with a behavioral health professional if available.  If the level of risk is high: Multiple ongoing stressors, along with persistent disruptive homicidal thoughts or ideation with a homicidal plan coupled with a strong intention to act on the homicidal plan, as evidenced by rehearsals or prior anger and/or violent episodes, indicate high acute risk. Address the underlying stressors contributing to the service member’s current crisis. Engage the service member with a behavioral health professional via telehealth if available.  If the aforementioned recommendations are inadequate to reduce risk for high‐risk service members, provide 24‐hour watch which will require the service member to be in line of sight of a designated observer so that any indication of harmful behaviors is addressed immediately.",

Maybe I could try that and then, if she doesn’t answer, I can use some relaxation exercises.” 4. Implement solutions and verify. Check in with SPC Hill as he attempts some alternative approaches. Chaplain/Command‐Level Interventions In addition to individual service member coping strategies and leveraging available social support, a service member may benefit from additional support resources, including engagement by the chain of command. For example, a chaplain is more likely to be closer to a deployed/forward location than a behavioral health specialist. Most chaplains are trained in basic counseling and are usually familiar with common behavioral health conditions, based on working closely with behavioral health counselors in prior duty assignments. Chaplains have the additional benefit of complete confidentiality, which makes this a less stigmatizing resource than traditional behavioral health. Senior members of the chain of command are better positioned to facilitate home‐front communication as the operational mission allows and within the constraints of available technology. These deployed resources may be able reach back and mobilize garrison resources to assist the service member’s loved ones. For example, a Navy ombudsman may be able to reach out to a spouse and connect them with legal or financial services to actively engage the issue causing the stress on the deployed service member. DEPRESSIVE EPISODES: IMPACT AND CONSIDERATIONS Depression is one of the most common behavioral health conditions in our society, affecting almost 20 million Americans (7.8% of the population) each year.19 As an all‐volunteer force, base rates of depression in the military population mirror that of the general public, with some estimates that rates of depression are higher (e.g., 12‐13%) in certain segments of the military population, such as currently or formerly deployed service members.20,21 Because of the continued stigma of behavioral health, it is likely that there are many more service members experiencing sub‐ clinical depression or perhaps even suffering from untreated clinical depression. Ideally, a service member suffering from depression will self‐identify during the pre‐deployment phase (e.g., via the Pre‐Deployment Health Assessment or the annual Periodic Health Assessment/Mental Health Assessment). However, it is not uncommon for service members who are motivated to deploy to under‐report or completely deny behavioral health symptoms on these pre‐deployment screens. In addition, it is equally possible that a service member with no prior behavioral health history may develop a depressive episode on an extended deployment/forward environment. In response to hostile and traumatic events exposure during combat environment, some service members might be vulnerable to stressors that affect their behavioral health. Stressors might include occupational/operational stressors, exposure to death of peers, loss of peers due to injury or combat, and killing of combatant, which might lead to feelings of moral injury, guilt, and/or depression. Additional stressors that might exacerbate depression include fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and home‐front issues. MINIMUM, BETTER, & BEST INTERVENTIONS Minimum: Use the 5 Rs, Basic Listening, and Validation One of the best interventions for any behavioral health condition, to include depression, is prevention. To that end, a good front‐line intervention is to encourage service members to practice good self‐care to the extent that the Chapter 4: Management of Most Common Behavioral Health Conditions That May Manifest in Forward Environments 10",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel PANIC ATTACKS Panic attacks are, by definition, a fear of one’s own panic symptoms and can happen alongside trauma symptoms and independent of any other behavioral health issue.29 Specifically, panic attacks occur when individuals perceive bodily sensations as life‐threatening; for example, increased inhalation of carbon dioxide can provoke panic attacks as it can trigger perceived suffocation.30 Panic attacks include similar sensations to an ASR or CSR and might look similar to the outside observer. They are driven by a physical and cognitive reaction to stress‐related sensations that, essentially, spiral into a dysfunctional state. ASR and panic attacks have a similar presentation and can be linked, as past exposure to significant stressors can predispose a person to panic attacks. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction has been reported in adults with anxiety and panic attacks.31 Panic attacks are also common among service members, particularly in those with combat‐related exposure.32,33 During unfamiliar or threatening environments, military personnel who experienced ASRs in the past may be more likely to experience panic symptoms in the future.34 IMPORTANCE OF INTERVENING Helping service members restore to function in the midst of a CSR or panic attack has important effects on the individual service member and unit, as well as imparting confidence moving forward in continued demands of an operational environment. CSRs and panic attacks look similar in the moment and are most observable by an inability to function. CSRs might happen in the midst of a firefight, whereas a panic attack can happen in any non‐threatening or mildly stressful setting, as it is a reaction to physical sensations, rather than the environment itself. Regarding individual effects, whereas most service members with ASR do recover, service members who have experienced previous CSRs are at higher risk for both short‐term and long‐term psychopathology, such as acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder.35 Addressing stress reactions early helps prevent downrange psychopathology, by thwarting or slowing the development of the disorder.36 Therefore, ASRs may be a window to intervene and prevent further deterioration. Regarding unit effects, interventions for CSR and panic are primarily peer‐based; when fellow service members are empowered to intervene when a teammate loses ability to function, the entire unit will perform better and experience increased safety.27 Because of the overlap of ASRs and panic attacks, similar interventions can be used to help reorient a person in the moment. ASRs occur during or directly after exposure to a stressor. Panic attacks are, by definition, reactions without any real danger. Therefore, ASRs and panic attacks likely occur in different environments, and as time passes, may require different approaches. This chapter focuses on using brief, immediate interventions during an ASR or panic attack. We also offer a brief description of panic disorder and the development of other stressor‐related issues that require consultation with a behavioral health asset. HELPING A SERVICE MEMBER RETURN TO FUNCTION DURING A COMBAT STRESS REACTION OR PANIC ATTACK The methods of grounding (minimum), tactical breathing (better), and iCOVER (best) are ordered according to how comprehensive the intervention is. Because the stress process and panic attacks involve both physical and cognitive components, methods taught to purposefully regulate autonomic systems and their arousal usually include cognitive and physical components. The cognitive component usually encourages some way to focus thought into a neutral, non‐ emotional path to reduce cognitively mediated arousal. This focus may include self‐talk or more benign activities, such as counting respirations, visualizing relaxing situations, a focus on sound, and/or the repetition of some other sensory stimulus. The physical component of this intervention usually includes abdominal breathing, with intentional relaxation of various muscles in a systematic way.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non-Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 5: Psychopharmacological Interventions in Forward Locations 6 Insomnia The formulary offers two antihistamines that may be used for insomnia; their side effects may cause drowsiness or a hangover feeling the next morning with some sluggishness.10 Certain psychotropics that are indicated for other reasons could also be used in small doses, such as trazodone (an antidepressant), or quetiapine (an SGA). BZDs and the z-class of hypnotics generally work well, however the risks involved in co-administration with other medications or alcohol should be taken into account, in addition to their potential for addiction when taken regularly over time. An over-the-counter substance, melatonin, is a naturally occurring chemical in the brain, that can be taken orally. In spite of their common use for this reason, the benefit of this approach is not well established. Additionally, melatonin is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with no assurance of dose or the purity mentioned on the label. Coping with Psychosocial Stressors (e.g., Relationship, Family, Financial) Usually, behavioral interventions and supportive psychotherapy are best suited to deal with situations like these. However, in case of severe distress or impairment of functioning, one can use interventions covered under the paragraph for acute stress reactions. Acute Depressions/Major Depressive Disorder/Dysthymic Disorder There are several medication groups that are helpful in the long-term management of these conditions. Currently, SSRIs are most commonly used to their general overall safety and tolerability.11 No blood tests or electrocardiogram (ECG) is required before the institution of treatment. For acute depressive episodes, care needs to be paid to the risk of suicidal ideation or plans, and measures should be taken to ensure safety. Similar to what was covered earlier, and in case of sever distress or impairment of functioning, one can use interventions covered under the paragraph for acute stress reactions. On the other hand, if a service member is known to be on an antidepressant and develops symptoms of the serotonin syndrome (see below), steps should be taken to maintain safety. First step should be to discontinue all medications that increase serotonin in the brain – not just the antidepressants. Next step is the transfer of the patient to a higher role. Acute Stress Reactions and Panic Attacks The treatment for acute stress reactions and panic attacks is different from long term treatment of panic disorder. In an acute situation, BZDs work promptly and effectively. However, as mentioned earlier, this should be weighed against the situation the service member is in on the field, and impact of their side effects on the service member. Alternatively, adrenergic agents could be used, again with care paid to their side effects, mainly lowering the blood pressure. Recurrent Panic Attacks and Panic Disorder Serotonin acting medications (SSRIs and SNRIs) are very effective medications for the treatment of panic disorder and for decreasing and ameliorating the frequency and severity of the panic attacks. However, it will take several weeks of regular use to get the desired effects, which would also require continuous use over time. Care should be given to dosing of these medications in the case of panic disorder. Medications should be started at a significantly lower dose than when used in other conditions and titrated up slowly over several weeks. Anger Management Anger is a common emotional state that all humans experience, and it is commonly expressed and dealt with in an appropriate, safe, and constructive manner. Occasionally, some individuals are not able to manage or deal with their anger in a healthy way and can place their or others’ wellbeing or lives at risk. These severe cases of dysfunctional behavioral symptom might have an underlying psychological or medical cause, or can be precipitated by an acute event: behavioral, psychological, or medical. The focus of management of acute bout of anger, is to maintain safety of service member and others while keeping in mind any and all underlying conditions that might require a transfer to a higher Role. The protocol for management of acute agitation should be followed.",

There is a great deal of pressure involved with being a primary or sole caregiver (e.g., due to medical personnel shortages in the austere environment, etc.). They are often highly valued, sought out for guidance, and making significant life-saving decisions – all of which can become overwhelming for someone who is often not well- versed in being the only caregiver available to treat the injured and dying.4,31-34 MANAGING BURNOUT As discussed above, burnout is not a result of personal failure. It is due to a stressful environment that can force difficult decisions and cause moral distress to add up over time. However, there are some things that individuals can do personally and for each other that reduce the impact. Self and buddy care followed by a focus on organizational and systems-level change may be needed when burnout occurs.4,31 SELF-CARE Self-care includes general activities that can reduce many types of personal distress.4,33,34 These activities may include physical activity and exercise, social time with others, and pleasurable activities, like watching a favorite television show or playing a card game.4,33,34 Also, a person may reach a threshold in which professional mental health intervention is needed and may seek services based on the resources available (see Chapter 1). In high stress environments, conflict within a medical team may increase. The ability of an individual to manage conflict well is an aspect of positive self-care.37,38 It is important to recognize the difference between conflict and abusive behavior. Components that would indicate behavior is abusive include 1. the behavior is physically threatening, 2. the behavior is causing or likely to cause harm or damage to people or property, and 3. the behavior is verbally abusive. Examples include racist, sexist, homophobic statements, or name- calling, etc. 37,38 Recognizing the underlying need may help to de-escalate the situation quickly. Acceptance of the inevitability of conflict in most situations and learning how to best recognize and addressing it will likely produce more positive outcomes than taking it personally or unloading an already stressed colleague. The DELUDE Coping Model can be used to help improve your coping strategy when conflict arises: Don’t take it personally, Engage with the person, Listen, Understand the problem and Deal with it, and Escalate the concern if necessary. 37,38 BUDDY CARE When social support is high at work, burnout levels are lower. 39 Demonstrating high levels of compassion or care for others in the workplace is associated with positive outcomes both personally and in the workplace.39 In the deployed work context, buddy care might include joking or using humor, engaging with one’s buddies and asking them how they",

For example, some behavior issues might be relaƟvely normal or expected for speciﬁc ages. You may already know the unit, military occupaƟon code, and deployment‐related informaƟon.  How old are you?  Are you married or do you have a partner?  Do you have children or other dependents?  What’s your job? How long have you been in this posiƟon?  How long have you been deployed? Stress and Recent Trauma Exposure RaƟonale: This informaƟon will give you a sense of their daily stress experience and to what extent recent events may contribute to their current state. For example, if they were recently in a ﬁre ﬁght, then some sleep disturbance or emoƟonal outbursts may be normal.  What’s been on your plate recently?  What kinds of stress have you been dealing with? [ask follow‐up quesƟons with consideraƟons of ﬁnancial, legal, and family stressors]  Have you had any recent intense stressors where you felt helpless and out of control? [not necessary to get into detail; use quesƟon to get a sense of recent trauma exposure without delving into the event] Substance Use RaƟonale: This informaƟon will help you rule out whether their current behavior may be related to withdrawal or acute intoxicaƟon.  Have you ever needed treatment for drug or alcohol use that you couldn’t control?  Have you ever had signiﬁcantly more alcohol than you wanted?  How much caﬀeine do you have on a daily basis?  Have you ever used illegal drugs? Have you recently used any drugs?  Have you ever had a history of an alcohol problem? Violence or Suicide RaƟonale: Past suicide or homicide related behavior are predictors of risk and future behavior. If the service member previously engaged in self‐ or other‐directed violent behavior then they are signiﬁcantly greater risk. Look towards Chapter 3 for suicide risk intervenƟons.  Have you ever had thoughts of suicide?  If yes, have you thought of how you would do it?  Have you ever acted on those thoughts? Have you ever aƩempted suicide?",

Radiog­ raphy is also appropriate for documentation of correct thoracostomy tube placement. Perform thoracic radiography on every traumatized MWD, if available, even if there is no clinical evidence of thoracic trauma. A significant number of trauma patients without outward evidence of chest trauma have hid­ den trauma that may manifest later, complicate management, or worsen with treatment of other conditions. TFAST should be performed on every MWD that presents with a history of trauma, if the HCP has significant experience in its use; TFAST requires a high degree of experience to optimize diagnostic reliability. As with hu­ man casualties, TFAST is sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of pneumothorax and pulmonary parenchymal fluid, and for rapidly evaluating for pericardial and pleural effusions.4 Figure 27 shows the imaging locations for TFAST in the dog.

    "text": "  CHAPTER 15 Ocular Injuries Ocular injuries in MWDs in deployed settings will likely include irritant conjunctivitis, corneal ulceration, eyelid lacerations, and penetrating foreign objects. Clinical signs of ocular and periocular injury include eyelid lacera­ tions, swelling of the periorbital tissues or conjunctiva, exudate in the conjunctival sac or on the eyelids, blepharospasm, intense redness of the conjunctiva, epiphora, photophobia, and rubbing the eye. Penetrating foreign objects may be present. Evaluations of Ocular Injuries 1. Sedate the MWD as needed to allow detailed but safe examination of the affected eye (See Chapter 16). 2. Flush the affected eye and adjacent tissues with copious amounts of sterile saline or ophthalmic rinse. 3. Topically anesthetize the affected eye to facilitate examination, using 3-4 drops of topical ophthalmic anesthetic solution (e.g., proparacaine) on the cornea. 4. Remove exudate from the affected eye, if present, using saline-soaked cotton balls. 5. Examine the conjunctival area for foreign objects (e.g., particles, grass, plant seeds, thorns). 6. Stain the cornea of any affected eye using fluorescein stain to evaluate for ulceration. 7. Apply stain to the cornea, allow stain to dwell for at least 1 minute, and then rinse copiously with sterile saline or ophthalmic rinse. 8. Examine the eyes for symmetry, anisocoria, abnormal PLRs, or lens abnormalities. 9. While specific treatment of these problems is beyond the scope of practice for HCPs, the presence of these findings may suggest additional injury (e.g., TBI), that may need to be managed by the HCP. 10. Apply a bucket to the dog‘s collar to prevent self-trauma in ALL cases of ocular or periocular injuries in MWDs until the problem has resolved (See Figure 21 and Figure 22). Treatment of Ocular Injuries 1. Irritant conjunctivitis • Noted by varying degrees of conjunctival hyperemia, mild-to-moderate chemosis, and absence of other ocular signs. • Flush eye and adjacent tissues with sterile saline/ophthalmic rinse 1-2 times daily.

Ventilator settings should be coordinated with the transferring physician, anesthesia provider or respiratory therapist. Verify settings, review arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, and current SPO2 and ETCO2 readings. Place those setting on transport vent and place patient on transport vent early to verify patient tolerance and compatibility. 3. ABG should be done within 30 minutes of flight. If time allows, patient should be on transport ventilator for at least 15 minutes prior to transport. 4. Ventilator settings for en-route care team should initially be matched to those of the transferring facility. Adjust settings PRN in order to maintain appropriate clinical parameters listed on first page of ventilator management protocol or transferring physician orders. 5.

Provide 100% oxygen to all trauma patients and any patient that is showing signs of respiratory distress, until proven unnecessary.4 Oxygen cages (makeshift or manufactured) and oxygen tents are impractical or not available in the typical HCP situation, so evacuate the MWD to the supporting veterinary facility if long-term oxygen therapy is necessary. Conscious MWDs: Use face mask or “blow by” technique (hold end of oxygen tubing or circuit as close to nose and mouth as possible or attach to muzzle) using high flow rates of 10-15 L/min.5 Use caution; ensure handler has control of the MWD at all times. Agitated, distressed or dyspneic MWDs will bite and can cause serious injury to the HCP or MWD handler. Figure 24 shows simple yet effective techniques to safely provide “blow­ by” oxygen supplementation to muzzled MWDs. While not the ideal method, acceptable inspired oxygen concentrations of 40-70% are achieved with this technique,5 which may be life-saving. Unconscious MWDs: Use tracheal insufflation, orotracheal intubation, or tracheostomy (see Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6 for techniques). Figure 24.

Training aid ingestion and toxicity are events unique to MWDs and working dogs employed by law enforcement agencies. • Training aids that are of concern when ingested include nitrate-based explosives (TNT, water gel, dynamite, RDX , detonation cords, and C-4), smokeless powder, sodium and potassium chlorates, and drugs (marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and amphetamines).1 • Potential toxicity is a concern and it is plausible that HCPs will be presented with an MWD that has ingested a training aid and is or may become toxic. Clinical Signs of Intoxication (by Agent) MWD handlers will have critical knowledge of the agent to which an MWD was exposed, for training aid ingestion. Common agents used and associated clinical signs follow. • Nitrate/nitroglycerin-based explosives. Ingestion may result in hypersalivation, severe CNS abnormalities (ataxia, incoordination, seizures, tremors), gastrointestinal irritation (nausea, vomiting), and methemoglobinemia (cyanosis, weakness, syncope, respiratory distress). • Smokeless powder explosive. Ingestion may result in hypotension, CNS depression (ataxia, depressed mentation, incoordination), and methemoglobinemia (cyanosis, weakness, syncope, respiratory distress). • Potassium and sodium chlorate explosives. Ingestion may result in methemoglobinemia (cyanosis, weak­ ness, syncope, and respiratory distress), CNS abnormalities (ataxia, incoordination, and depressed menta­ tion), gastrointestinal irritation (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping and pain, hemorrhagic diarrhea with melena or hematochezia), hematuria, hemoglobinuria, and renal and liver failure. • Marijuana/hashish. Ingestion may result in altered mentation (disorientation), hallucinations (in the dog, typically manifested as vocalizing, useless scratching, hyperexcitability), nausea and vomiting, and respira­ tory distress. • Heroin. Ingestion may result in bradycardia, respiratory distress, miosis, coma, and sudden death. • Cocaine and amphetamines. Ingestion may result in restlessness, tachycardia, hyperexcitability, vocalization, excessive or unprovoked aggression, seizures, and mydriasis. Treatment of Training Aid Toxicity1 If ingestion occurred ≤ 4 hours before presentation and the MWD is conscious and has normal CNS respons­ es, induce vomiting. Training Aid Toxicoses in MWDs 100",

I will put it over here for safe keeping.”  If the patient is not willing to voluntarily surrender their weapon, then assistance from Military Police or the Chain of Command may be needed.  Crowding, bright lights, noise, and waiting with others can further agitate a patient. When possible, move the patient to a low‐simulation environment which is safe for both the patient and staff.6 Better:  Consult and coordinate with Command to remove the service member’s weapon AND respond to agitated service members with assessment for underlying medical conditions. Also take a stepped approach to de‐ escalation with a focus on safety.  This stepped approach to agitation includes non‐violent and behavioral approaches before relying on pharmacological intervention or physical restraint. If necessary, the provider might include an action plan and spatial layout of the area for use of seclusion or separation, with a team approach to the agitated service member and rehearsals for these situations.  Use verbal de‐escalation skills.6  Respect the personal space of the patient.  Have one designated medical staff engage the patient by introducing themselves.  Provide the patient with concise, simple instructions (repeat instructions multiple times).  Appeal to the patient’s wants and needs (listen for anything you might be able to offer them, such a comfort item or psychotherapy).  Set limits and reinforce appropriate behavior (such as safety, mutual respect).  Offer choices (provide choices between medications or route of administration, when possible).  Pharmacological Intervention for agitation: Pharmacological intervention can be administered to agitated service member to reduce the risk of harm to self or others. This option might not be viable in far‐forward environments due to limited resources. Medications commonly used for pharmacological intervention are available at Role 1. However, pharmacological intervention may require an order by a medical professional who is authorized to prescribe medication when a service member is incompetent to make medical decisions for self, or if the behavior of service member poses a risk to either self or others. See Chapter 5 for additional details.  Physical restraint: If the patient continues to threaten staff, others, or themselves, as a final resort, physical restraints might be necessary to keep them and others safe. However, physical restraints need to be administered under the supervision or guidance of trained professionals. Continue to use a regulated, calm approach and converse with the patient throughout any period of restraint. Consider: 1. Why the restraint is being used. 2. What type of restraint will be used. 3. Length of time for which restraint is intended to be used. Best:  Use the strategies above and gather information about patient clinical history and collateral information about possible causes of the agitation.",

Exact diagnosis is not necessarily the goal. For brief assessment and intervention, see below. Minimum:  Disarm and make sure patient is in quiet, safe place.  Observe patient to ensure safety to self and others.  Determine suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent, or plan.  Do not challenge the veracity of hallucinations or delusions.  Minimize consequences of manic symptoms and channel excess of energy in productive tasks (e.g., ditch digging). Better:  Rule out possible substance misuse (i.e., alcohol)  Determine and stabilize influence of alcohol or substance use that might cause symptoms.  Minimize ability to act on command hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms. Best:  Acute short‐term psychopharmacological management (see Chapter 5) until symptoms abate.  Injectable form of an antipsychotic with a benzodiazepine might be needed in case of acute psychosis with harm to self or others where hospitalization is not yet possible. PSYCHOSIS: PREVALENCE AND ETIOLOGY Psychosis is a composite of many behavioral health symptoms characterized by a loss of contact with reality and can be seen in several different behavioral health and medical disorders. It is the primary feature of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and other psychotic disorders as well as a secondary feature of co‐occurring mood and substance disorders. Psychosis can also be found as a complicating symptom in many neurologic and medical conditions. Psychosis is often highly distressing to patients and should be a primary target of treatment.23 A first episode of psychosis can be preceded by a prodromal phase (period of early incubation when symptoms first start) that lasts for six months. Prodromal changes include gradual, non‐specific changes in mood, thoughts, perceptions, behaviors, and functioning (e.g., sleep, eating, hygiene, job performance, and sociability). During the prodromal stage, patients have yet to clearly manifest psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations or delusions). According to the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of First‐Episode Psychosis and Schizophrenia,24 early warning signs of psychosis include:  Worrisome drop in grades or job performance.  New trouble thinking clearly or concentrating.  Suspiciousness, paranoid ideas, or uneasiness with others.  Social withdrawal or more time spent alone than usual.",

Thus, an assessment for psychosis may occur either through self‐report of the service member, or the observation, report, or rating by fellow service members or unit leadership. The assessment tool suggested for use by the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of First‐Episode Psychosis and Schizophrenia is the Structured Interview for Psychosis‐Risk Syndromes. 24,26 However, a brief tool more easily used in the field and included in the CPG is the Early Psychosis Screener‐26 (EPS‐26).27 The screener is a self‐ report survey that can be administered in 8 minutes and can be taken anywhere with internet access, without the help of a clinician. A two‐minute version of the survey is accessible at http://www.eps.telesage.com/ . A simplified paper version is also available for download at the above link. PSYCHOSIS: RULE OUTS Early identification of and interventions for psychotic disorders can reduce the future burden of care associated with such disorders.24 Early detection can occur through differential diagnosis and recognizing prodromal changes in a patient.  Differential diagnosis 23: To differentiate between primary psychotic disorders and psychotic disorders associated with medical or neurologic conditions, consider the following factors:  Age of onset: Primary psychotic disorders usually present between late teens and early 30s. Men typically present with this disorder at younger ages than women. Psychotic disorders associated with medical conditions are more likely to occur after the age of 40.  Pattern of onset: In the prodromal stage of a psychotic disorder, symptoms are often subtle and can be confused with other disorders (e.g., schizophrenia can be confused with depression). If psychotic symptoms are acute, they are likely due to medical or neurologic psychosis.  Genetic: It is common for patients with non‐medical psychotic disorders to have a family history of psychotic disorders.  Presentation: Primary psychotic disorders often first manifest in times of high/significant life stress.  Hallucinations: Primary psychotic disorders are often synonymous with auditory hallucinations. Psychosis due to medical conditions are often accompanied by other forms of hallucinations (e.g., visual, tactile). PSYCHOSIS: INTERVENTIONS The primary objective of interventions is to assess the safety of patients in prodromal stages of psychosis. If observing psychosis, most psychotic states are not violent. If psychosis is drug induced, violence is more likely to be observed. Minimum:  Disarm and make sure patient is in quiet, safe place.  Observe patient to ensure safety to self and others.  Do not challenge the veracity of hallucinations or delusions.  Determine suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent, or plan.  Minimize consequences of psychotic symptoms and help minimize patient anxiety related to symptoms. Better:  Rule out possible drug use (i.e. hallucinogens).",

Minimum/Better/Best Intervention Recommendations. Minimum: Command Consultation (see Chapter 6) along with Safety and De-Escalation of Crisis Situation The provider is encouraged to inform the command of both high as well as low risk homicidal service members through a command consultation when a service member is identified as being either a high or low risk for homicidal ideations or attempt. To effectively manage and monitor service members contemplating homicide, the command consultation should be followed by removal of access to lethal means along with unit or buddy watch where feasible. Below are a few scripts to help with removal of lethal means:  “I see that you’re upset. It’s our policy here to place your weapon on the rack when you walk in. Will you place it over there”?  “Please hand your weapon to me. I will put it over here for safe keeping.”  If the service member will not offer the weapon voluntarily, request assistance from the Military Police.  Additionally, if there is a determination of high risk for homicide, limited duty disposition should be recommended. The service member should not engage in regular duties at this time and ongoing monitoring is required. The command consultation chapter elaborates more on this guidance in Chapter 6.  However, in instances where there is a determination of low homicidal risk, duty restrictions may not be needed. The service member may engage in regular duties but would still need to be monitored for changes in intent and homicidal risk. Level of Risk Management Recommendations Risk Indicators Minimum Better Best Low Acute Risk ‐ Occasional Homicidal Ideation ‐ No Intention to act, no plan or rehearsal of homicidal act ‐ No history of prior attempt ‐ Reflective listening to de‐ escalate ‐ Provide 5 Rs, rest reassurance, replenish, restore confidence, and return to duty ‐ Encourage self‐ management of stress (e.g., tactical breathing, mindfulness etc.) ‐ Address ongoing stressors (e.g., relationship concerns, lack of sleep, financial management) ‐ Provide reassurance and supportive counselling ‐ Provide resource education/awareness (e.g., Ministry or spiritual resources) *For low and high acute risk, in addition to the minimum and better strategies: ‐Monitor for changes in symptoms ‐Command consult if appropriate (e.g., potential victim identified, and service member has worked out a plan to act on the ideation) High Acute Risk ‐ Persistent intrusive homicidal thoughts and/or ideation ‐ Strong intention with plan to act on homicidal ideation ‐ Recent anger and/or violent episodes ‐ Means safety, secure access to lethal means ‐ Initiate command consult and notify potential victim ‐ Place service member on limited duty ‐ Provide Buddy Aid and consider unit watch ‐ Means safety and command consult if needed ‐ Notification of warning to potential victim if feasible ‐ Problem solving approaches by medic or buddy (e.g., reflective listening, de‐escalation and challenging negative thinking) ‐ Provide warning notification to the victim ‐ Safety planning for the at‐risk person ‐ Provide additional support and help resources such as chaplaincy or tele‐ behavioral health",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel suboptimal and proceed accordingly. Recall that for optimal cognitive and physical function, both sufficient sleep quantity and sleep quality is required. BEST 8 Consecutive Hours of Sleep per 24‐hour Period with Optimal Environment During Nighttime. The best sleep management strategy facilitating maximum cognitive and physical performance is eight or greater hours (dependent on individual need) of uninterrupted, continuous sleep in an optimal sleep environment at a consistently timed sleep schedule across both on and off duty days to leverage the circadian rhythm.7 The factors of sufficient available time, appropriate environment, and appropriate circadian timing constitute the ideal context for best sleep opportunity. Note that, in this context, individuals who experience difficulty falling and staying asleep may lack adequate sleep ability as described above with insomnia, which requires separate treatment and management. Augment with Sleep Banking and Restorative Sleep In operational environments, temporary periods of sleep deprivation may be unavoidable. In these cases, when such periods are anticipated, proactive use of sleep banking can somewhat mitigate, but not substantially reduce or eliminate, negative consequences. Sleep banking refers to increasing the opportunity to sleep several days to a week prior to a period of sleep deprivation, generally up to 10 hours.7 This is best accomplished via an earlier bedtime, if sufficient sleepiness is present, in order to maintain a consistent wake time. The use of restorative sleep after sleep deprivation can also aid recovery. Restorative sleep refers to allowing for similarly increased sleep opportunities afterward. In practice, several days of up to ten hours of post‐deprivation sleep provides benefit while not dampening sleep drive long term. However, research studies suggest that, in prolonged cases, up to fourteen hours of sleep may be necessary for the brain to physiologically readjust.6 More recovery time will, generally, be needed for periods of sleep deprivation lasting several days than it would for just a single day of sleep loss. These strategies can be used to augment the minimum, better, best practices described above or when such practices are not feasible. Caution Regarding Wake‐Promoting Substances Readily accessible alerting agents are widely used among military populations, largely consisting of caffeine in drinks and other forms, and nicotine. Prescription alerting agents are available as well. Alerting agents have not been shown to be an effective substitute for sleep.10 Caution should be taken regarding use of these substances; alerting agents may serve to sustain wakefulness, to an extent, but do not reverse the accrued deficits in cognitive and physical function. Performance of duty will still be reduced. Additionally, alerting agents may interfere with subsequent sleep and, as a result, the ability to recover from periods of sleep deprivation. At a minimum, they should not be used within six hours of attempted sleep. Recommendation against Periods of Sleep Deprivation Exceeding 16‐24 Hours Cognitive and physical abilities begin to deteriorate when individuals are deprived of sleep for 16‐24 hours. In this period of acute sleep deprivation, performance decrements are observed in attention, reaction time, and focus, while an increase in both errors of commission and omission are observed. Extended wakefulness of this nature produces impairment in psychomotor tasks equivalent to moderate alcohol intoxication (0.05‐0.10% BAC).11 After 24 hours of sleep deprivation, the following abilities, critical to operational readiness, are significantly impacted:12 • Acquiring, assigning priorities, allocating, and using resources. • Anticipating and solving problems. • Managing and exploiting change. • Acting decisively under pressure. • Establishing position. • Requesting fire.

Do you mind if we sit down, grab some water, and I ask follow‐up questions?” • Give reasons for requests and be genuine/honest. • Make an apology or change if necessary. • Offer choices and options, so the service member can feel empowered. Example: “Do you want to sit in this chair over here, or would you prefer to go outside the tent?” • Be flexible, negotiate, compromise, and avoid power struggle. • Resist the urge to offer immediate solutions or advice; instead listen, paraphrase to indicate that you are listening and reflecting, and encourage service member to problem solve. Example: “I hear you saying that you are having issues at home, and you are having difficulty sleeping. Is that right?” “You also think that the issues at home are bothering you, and those thoughts are interfering with work, making you irritable?” “What do you think could help you manage the situation? Have you tried some of the techniques that were taught to us during Basic training to help with stress?” “Would you like me to help you work on those techniques?” Tactical/Belly Breathing Ideally a service member will be familiar with these interventions and have practiced them with some positive benefit. • Get to a place where both the provider and the service member have the best opportunity to actually feel the stomach move in and out while breathing. • Ask service member to place one hand right above belly button and to place the other hand on chest. Demonstrate or help service member with the actions if needed. • Next, ask service member to take a big breath in, then breathe out, to feel the diaphragm at work. Instruct service member to begin breathing in with a closed mouth doing their best to keep chest level stationary. Instructions include: “Keep your mouth closed and start breathing in to the count of four. Focus on feeling your breath fill up your belly area. Try to keep your chest level stationary and fill your belly with air by feeling your hand on your belly getting pushed out further and further.” • Ask the service member to pause for a count of four. “Feel your belly full of air.” • Next ask the service member to exhale through mouth to the count of 4. “Now, begin to exhale through your mouth, feel your stomach moving towards you as you breathe out.” • Ask service member to repeat exercises five times or until breathing is stabilized. There are many apps available for free download to a smartphone such as the Defense Health Agency’s Connected Health Branch (formerly the National Center for Telehealth & Technology or T2) apps like “Tactical Breather,” “Breath2Relax” and “Mindfulness Coach” (https://8tharmy.korea.army.mil/site/assets/doc/newcomers/medical‐care/Mobile‐Apps.pdf ).

These apps provide visual and verbal cues to guide a member through basic emotion‐focused coping strategies. Some also include the ability to track changes in mood or sleep and contain various educational material as well. Additional Techniques These techniques could be used include the practice of meditation or yoga that includes mindfulness. Mindfulness comprises mental training that helps with focusing attention to the present. (See Appendix E) This approach has been trained, implemented, and found effective in the U.S. Military.17 Below is an example of the steps involved: 1. Take a moment to get comfortable. 2. Feel free to close your eyes. 3. Settle in and let go of any unnecessary tension in your body and mind. 4. Take three deep and slow breaths; now let your breathing return to normal pace. 5. Focus your attention on where you feel the breath most – that’s the target of your attention. For example, it could be your nostrils, your chest, or your shoulders. Select what is most salient for you and focus on it. 6. Notice when your mind wanders away from the target, and when it does, return it back gently to the sensation. 7. Practice this exercise for two to three minutes. 8. Gently bring movement back into the hands and feet as you complete the practice and return to everyday life. Help by buddy includes identification of the stress through active listening and use of the 5 Rs namely Reassure, Rest, Replenish, Restore, and Return. Active listening can be used to identify concerns of the service member as well as developing strategies to resolve the concerns. Better: Buddy Aid In addition to the de‐escalation and self‐care comprising the 5 Rs, a service member may benefit from available social support. In a deployed/forward environment, social support often comes from other unit members. Called by various names such as “buddy care,” “battle buddy,” or “buddy aid,” these interventions involve leveraging other unit members as a source for listening and offering moral support. Ideally unit members have been exposed to basic training or knowledge on active listening as a preferred method for social support (i.e., listening, paraphrasing, reflecting, and resisting the urge to offer immediate solutions or advice). A provider might consider helping the service member identify a low‐level stressor that might be easier to address and therefore build confidence. Alternatively, they might want to break down a larger stressor into components. Using the example of MAJ Morales, some strategies for identifying and addressing low level stressor is described below. Buddy or leader (LTC Champ) should first reach out to MAJ Morales and check if MAJ Morales would like to discuss his issues with them. If MAJ Morales agrees to discuss, move to a place that is quiet and initiate the conversation. Reflect on the concerns expressed by MAJ Morales. Paraphrase to indicate that you are listening as well as obtain clarity on the stressors faced by MAJ Morales. • Ask what’s happening using open‐ended questions. Example: “What’s upsetting you right now?” • Offer help and reorient the person to who you are, who they are, and where you are. Example: “I see you’re angry and maybe scared. I want to help. I am LT Johnson, the PA. We are at FOB XXX. We met before in the DFAC.” • Repeat back to the person what you heard to ensure accurate information and indicate that you are listening.

Can you share your tasks with a buddy? Is there any other support back home who could provide help in managing the concerns with your children?” Additional strategies that could help include motivational interviewing and encouraging the service member to reach out for help from additional sources, such as a chaplain. Best: Problem Solving Therapy Problem Solving Therapy (PST) is a similar, more structured approach to managing stressors. PST is similar to the Military Decision‐Making Process (MDMP), with which many service members are already familiar. Primary goals for PST include: 1. changing thoughts or appraisal of the stressors. 2. implementing specific behaviors and strategies to address the stressors.18 The specific approaches involve changing the nature of the situation, altering unhelpful views of the stressor, or a combination of both. For example, SPC Hill described in Chapter 2 was worried that his partner had relapsed because she had not responded to his calls for weeks. As shown in his responses to the BASIS‐24 (a self‐report measure of stress), he had a low sense of his ability cope with his current stress. In PST, a negative problem orientation (i.e. unhelpful views) includes: a) perceptions that problems are threats or are unsolvable; b)doubts about one’s own ability to cope, and c) low frustration tolerance. The loose structure of PST includes the following four steps: 1. Define the problem. “I can’t get in touch with my partner, and she might be in danger.” 2. Generate alternatives. “I could call her sister.” Chapter 4: Management of Most Common Behavioral Health Conditions That May Manifest in Forward Environments 9",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel include decreased physical activity, passive/avoidant style coping (e.g., not speaking up or lack of assertiveness), and absence of positive mood states, coupled with a lack of future oriented thinking. 2. Activity‐scheduling and problem‐solving. Activity‐monitoring could help to identify triggers of changes in mood. Example, MAJ Morales gets upset every time he has video call with his wife. Following the call, he becomes more withdrawn from others, skips meals, and prefers to go back to his barracks and avoid work. Problem‐ solving could include help with social‐skills training, such as assertiveness, resolution of issues with his wife, and encouragement of physically healthy behaviors needed, such as exercising instead of feeling lethargic and skipping meals. Example: MAJ Morales could be encouraged to create an activity list that uplifts his mood or activities that distract him from feeling depressed. Some of the activities possible in deployed environment are exercising, taking photographs, listening to music, talking to a buddy, cooking a meal, or writing in a journal that might be shared with a loved one on return from deployment. 3. Psychoeducation. Educate the service member that anxiety and depression arise from part of the brain that is trying to protect by getting the service member to avoid or isolate. Reinforce that exercise can produce healthy chemicals in the brain that lift mood and also provide positive experiences that mitigate depression. Self‐care activities that are often possible in this environment include exercising, reading, listening to music, praying, watching movies, nutrition/eating a balanced diet, and playing games (especially social games that can build comradery, such as cards). Quality social support will often serve to enhance mood, boost morale, and, at times, help a service member who is feeling down to establish some perspective. Psychological support, encouragement, and active listening by a buddy or peer could help boost morale of a service member. If technology and operational mission permits, a service member experiencing depression will also likely benefit from practicing some of the emotion‐focused interventions on the smartphone apps such as “Tactical Breather,” “Breath2Relax,” and “Mindfulness Coach.” Once downloaded, these apps can be accessed offline (no cell serviced needed) at a service member’s convenience. These apps provide visual and verbal cues to guide a member through basic emotion‐focused coping strategies. Some also include the ability to track changes in mood or sleep, as well as various educational material. Buddy Aid with Suicide Risk Assessment Because a symptom of depression is suicidal thoughts, forward/deployed medical personnel should always assess for acute suicide risk level (described in Chapter 3) for any service members with suspected depression. This recommendation is consistent with the most recent.22 Another symptom of depression (as well as many other conditions, such as stress and anxiety) is sleep problems, including insomnia and hypersomnia. Forward deployed providers should educate service members experiencing sleep problems about good sleep hygiene habits such as avoiding caffeine, practicing relaxation strategies at bedtime, and avoiding lying in bed for long periods of time without falling asleep. Best: Challenging Thoughts/Negative Beliefs In addition to building individual service member coping strategies and leveraging available social support, a service member may benefit from accessing organic resources, such as a chaplain or rotational behavioral health support from Role 2. Furthermore, strategies such as challenging thoughts/negative beliefs could help the service member problem‐ solve, as well as overcome, feelings of depression. Below is a brief example of challenging negative thoughts: • Appreciate that the service member has documented daily activities and triggers. Follow up by asking what is happening using open‐ended questions. Example: “I see that you are angry and maybe sad after you had a video call with your wife. Can you tell me more on what happened?” • Repeat back to the person what you heard to ensure accurate information and indicate that you are listening. Example: “I hear you saying that you think that you’re angry at your wife and you think that she is out to get you.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel ACUTE STRESS REACTIONS & PANIC ATTACKS: IMPACT & CONSIDERATIONS All service members have hardwired survival reactions, which are often functional in the wake of trauma or severe stress. Some service members will have involuntary, temporary reactions that overwhelm their ability to function, called “acute stress reactions,” that include physical, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional effects. These reactions become a problem when they stop service members from functioning, particularly during a combat situation. Combat stress reactions (CSRs), as one type of acute stress reaction (ASR), and panic attacks are overwhelming reactions to actual and perceived threats to life, respectively. Table 4.1 displays shared experiences of ASR and panic attacks according to the International Classification of Disease Manual, 10th edition23 and distinguishes features specific to ASR or panic attack. Rule‐outs for other, urgent medical ailments are also identified. Interventions, such as tactical breathing, grounding exercises and iCOVER for both ASRs and panic attacks, are immediately important as they can return service members to functioning. Immediate interventions can buffer against behavioral health disorders that may develop as a result of loss of function and stress. Table 4.1. Overlap and Distinctions of ASR Symptoms and Panic Attacks. Shared Presentation of ASR and Panic (ICD‐10) Symptoms Arousal Chest and Abdomen Brain and Mind Palpitations or pounding heart Difficulty breathing Feeling dizzy, unsteady, faint or light­ headed Sweating Feeling of choking Feelings that objects are unreal, or that oneself is distant or “not really here” Trembling or shaking Chest pain/discomfort Fear of losing control, going crazy, or passing out Dry mouth Nausea or stomach distress Fear of dying ASR Specific Panic Attack Specific Originates from an “exceptional” mental or physical stressor Originates from bodily sensations (fear of bodily symptoms) (e.g., combat) without external threat; triggered by excessive carbon dioxide inhalation Occur in environments where there is a known, life‐threatening Can occur in many routine environments (e.g., DFAC, training stressor (e.g., firefight) scenario) Typically longer in duration (0 ‐48 hours) Shorter in duration (20‐30 minutes) Rule‐out Other physical injury; service members may have a head injury Heart attack or other heart arrhythmia or gunshot wound ACUTE STRESS REACTIONS The stress reaction is commonly described as “fight, flight, or freeze” as a natural response to a threatening situation.24 The stress response is a process, rather than a specific reaction, that is shaped by the “dose” of the stressor (e.g. length of exposure, severity). As an example shown in Figure 1 below, one proposed sequence of response to traumatic stress (e.g., combat), called the “defense cascade,” starts with “freeze” to identify the threat, escalates to “flight or fight” , peaks with “fright” (i.e. tonic immobility), and leads to a “flag” and/or “faint” shutdown responses as the mind and body become overwhelmed.25 Chapter 4: Management of Most Common Behavioral Health Conditions That May Manifest in Forward Environments 14",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel MINIMUM, BETTER, AND BEST INTERVENTIONS MINIMUM Self /Buddy Aid with Techniques such as Grounding Grounding exercises are about using the five senses ‐‐ namely sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch – to reconnect mind and body in the present. It is our basic human senses that remind us that we are here now. Grounding exercises are helpful for many situations where an individual might feel overwhelmed or distracted by distressing thoughts, images, feelings, or memories. Examples include getting caught up in strong emotions like anxiety or anger, engaging in stressful circling thoughts, experiencing strong painful memory or a flashback, or waking up from a nightmare with a pounding heart (nocturnal panic attack). The most frequently used grounding approach is the 3‐3‐3 rule that comprises the following steps: 37,38 1. Name three things you can see: “Look around you and name three things you can see.” 2. Name three things you can hear: “Pay attention to the sounds around you, and name three that you can hear.” 3. Move three parts of the body: “That was good that you could identify the sound of rain; now can you move your right foot, left arm and nod your head?” Another option that might be more applicable to when the service member is not in a combat setting is the 5‐4‐3‐2‐1 technique that engages all five senses.37,38 Below is a description of the steps, as well as a sample script that could be used: 1. Engage memory and attention by having them count backwards from five. “MAJ Morales, I need you to count backward from 5.” 2. Have them identify them four, then three, then two, then one sensory object, in any order of sense. Here’s one example of that process: “Good job! MAJ Morales, can you now pay attention to the sounds around you and name four that you can hear?” “Very well done buddy. Now can you identify and tell me the names of three smells around you?” “Awesome that you were able to pick up the smell of coffee brewing. Now feel things around you and name two things that you can feel, is it hot? Is it soft?” “Take a sip of this mug and tell me what you are tasting.” BETTER Self/Buddy Aid Along with Techniques for Relaxation, such as Tactical Breathing As we are unable to consciously and directly slow our heart rate, we can use tactical breathing, which acts to slow heart rate from a stress‐induced high to a normal resting rate within a few minutes. Abdominal/belly breathing promotes slow and deep breathing by encouraging expansion of the abdomen rather than the chest. This technique is easily taught by having the individual place a hand on their chest and abdomen while breathing in slowly. Belly breathing can be done either while lying down on the floor or by sitting down on the floor or on a chair. Instructions are described below: • Get to a place where both the provider and the service member have the best opportunity to actually feel the stomach move in and out while breathing. • Ask the service member to place one hand right above belly button and to place the other hand on the chest. Demonstrate or help service member with the actions if needed. Chapter 4: Management of Most Common Behavioral Health Conditions That May Manifest in Forward Environments 17",

Instruct the service member to begin breathing in with a closed mouth doing their best to keep the chest level stationary. Instructions include: “Keep your mouth closed and start breathing in to the count of four. Focus on feeling your breath fill up your belly area. Try to keep your chest level and stationary and fill your belly with air by feeling your hand on your belly getting pushed out further and further.” • Ask the service member to pause for a count of four: “Feel your belly full of air.” • Next, ask the service member to exhale through mouth to the count of four. “Now, begin to exhale through your mouth, feel your stomach moving towards you as you breathe out.” • Ask service member to repeat the exercises five times or until breathing is stabilized. BEST: iCOVER iCOVER is a rapid, peer‐based protocol that applies grounding concepts.39 iCOVER is a six‐step protocol that can be completed in under 60 seconds.40 Providers (medical, non‐medical or peers) need to be trained in the intervention, which includes a 60‐minute didactic module and a 30‐minute practical exercise that is delivered as part of resiliency training. The intervention involves the following six steps: 1. Identify the team member who is experiencing an ASR, and make sure that there is no physical reason for their behavior. a. Is the service member in shock and immobilized? b. Is team member appearing frozen dissociated or agitated? c. Is the team member behaving erratically, such as dropping equipment or acting without regard to danger? 2. Connect to bring them to the present moment (eye contact, touch, hearing). a. Ask the service member to look at you; make eye contact. “MAJ. M, this is LTC. C, look at me.” b. Ask if they can hear you, state that you are going to squeeze their arm and request the service member to squeeze your arm. “MAJ M, this is LTC C, can you hear me? I am going to squeeze your arm ‐ can you feel it? Can you squeeze my arm?” 3. Offer commitment to reduce sense of isolation. Indicate to the team member that you are with them, that you are not going anywhere, and that the service member is not alone. “MAJ M, we are here at xx, we are under fire, I am here with you and will be here with you, you are not alone.” 4. Verify facts with simple questions to get the thinking brain back in gear. Ask two to three simple, fact‐based questions, such as what mission that the service member is currently on and who the team lead is. “MAJ M, tell me what mission we are on. Who is your chief?” 5. Establish order of events to reorient the individual. “We are here in X mission. We are under attack.” “Do you understand?” Chapter 4: Management of Most Common Behavioral Health Conditions That May Manifest in Forward Environments 18",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 8: Behavioral Health Impact of Mass Casualty Incidents 7 Forward Palliative Care and Considerations Regarding Deceased Military health care workers may be challenged by ethical issues and decisions during deployments. Often deployments were considered a departure from one’s usual health care job to a foreign location. With the advent of the COVID‐19 pandemic and response to other disasters such as hurricanes, floods, etc. where inclusion of military health care NSMP’s has been essential, deployments now come in various environments with a multitude of mission focuses. The current health care arena has created situations where ethical issues are probably even more likely to occur and can arise when clinicians face a substantial disparity between the medical capabilities of their own medical system and that of the indigenous health system of the country in which they are deployed15,16 identified the following six themes or ethical situations faced by military nurses during war which can be applied to any health care discipline while on deployment: 1. Resources/allocations: relates to the number and types of casualties, severity of injury, humanitarian efforts, and resources used to care for enemies and civilians. An ethical conflict may arise when resources are scarce, used on enemies, or used at all costs. 2. Core values: prioritizes the mission and needs of the military and adhering to military core values might create an ethical dilemma if the individual feels these come first over patients’ needs or suffering. 3. Code of ethics: can provide guidance and principles for the health care NSMP to adhere to and may help prevent ethical dilemmas while deployed. 4. Caring for the enemy: one of the biggest sources of conflict for those who have to care for them. Showing compassion for an enemy or prisoner who may mistreat the health care NSMP, or who may be alongside an injured military member, may prove challenging for the NSMP and test them in ways like never before. 5. Caring for civilians: Civilians injured due to the MASCAL event, may lead to conflicts to provider, due to lack of resources, culture differences, and time commitments. This care can be taxing and may seem futile to the deployed health care NSMP. There is a need for follow‐up/closing the loop after behavioral health care NSMPs care for severely injured service members and speculate outcomes. This unknowing can create doubt and speculation of responsibility for less than optimal care outcomes. For some behavioral health care NSMPs, it is helpful to seek “the rest of the story” to come to terms with the care they provided. Palliative care is an area of health care which often is associated with health care NSMP stress. Relieving suffering and improving quality of life are the foundational tenets of all health care NSMPs and often cause the most personal suffering. Recently, COVID‐19 has exacerbated palliative care issues in military health care. In response, a group of experts have created a military health care NSMPs toolkit for addressing palliative care needs. The final category of triage in MASCAL events involves the deceased service members. During MASCAL events, it is very likely that there may be limited or no access to a morgue. A MASCAL plan needs to include training and guidance on where to transfer the deceased and define space for the dead. It is imperative that the defined space should be outside of the treatment area and easily accessible to commanders and fellow service members who may want to pay respect to the deceased. Spaces to consider include morale welfare and a recreation tent. As indicated earlier the key to seamless management of behavioral issues during MASCAL events is advanced planning and rehearsal. The following section summarizes the behavioral health impact and potential actions that could help with managing the crisis.",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non-Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 9: NSMP Stress and Burnout Management Stress and Associated Conditions 2 Moral distress has implications for the safe delivery of health care, recruitment, and retention of the health care NSMPs, and the operational readiness of our forces.10,14,15 Military health care NSMPs have unique hardships that compound health care delivery and are at risk for psychological distress related to moral and ethical situations encountered within the often-unpredictable nature of military service.10,15-17 Studies have demonstrated military health care NSMPs experience emotional exhaustion, anxiety, depression, alcohol misuse, and posttraumatic stress syndrome when exposed to battlefield health care encounters.12-15,18, Moral injury occurs when a person experiences psychological consequences of betrayal by someone they regard as having legitimate authority over them in a high-stakes situation.19,20 Moral injury is not unique to service members but is often used in describing the psychological injuries of military warfighters.11,14,21 Military health care NSMPs are simultaneously warfighters and care NSMPs, which can lead to conflict and personal suffering. Bearing witness to, engaging in, or failing to act in situations which conflict with a military health care NSMP’s values or beliefs may result in suffering leading to in an increased risk of PTSD, depression, risk of suicidality, and an overall decrease in mental and physical health well-being.22-24 Moral injury situations can leave a person with feelings of guilt, shame, anger, embarrassment, and suffering.22,23 A morally injured person’s worldview can change from a standpoint of safety, security, goodness, and trust of people to experiencing helplessness, guilt, shame, and fear as a result of a threat to his/her life or the life of someone else.22,23 Compassion fatigue is a natural consequence of working with traumatized clients or those who experience extremely stressful events and results from giving high levels of energy and compassion without experiencing the positive outcome of seeing patients improve.11,25,26 It is caused by the prolonged or continuous exposure to these stressful events or by a single very intense event and is compounded by moral distress.11,25,26 It consists of two components: frustration from the inability to act in accordance with one’s beliefs and fear of reliving the stressful traumatic episode.25 Compassion fatigue results in decreased job satisfaction and can lead to burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Symptoms include anger, apathy, cynicism, irritable mood, reduced empathy, decreased tolerance, feeling overwhelmed, reduced sense of accomplishment, difficulty concentrating on job duties, inability to pay attention to detail, poor sleep, flashbacks, exhaustion, isolation, and poor coping.25 Compassion satisfaction is a fulfillment an individual derives from helping others -- a result from feeling empathy. It results in positive and emotional consequences such as feeling strength from having helped, satisfaction with one’s own situation and the work that was done, encouragement by work, and continued desire to assist others. Compassion satisfaction mitigates burnout and increases job satisfaction.27,28 Secondary trauma develops in health professionals who come into continuous and close contact with trauma survivors, while experiencing considerable emotional disruption themselves, and becoming indirect victims of trauma.28,29 Secondary trauma includes behaviors and emotions experienced as a result of exposure to another’s trauma such as irritability, inability to concentrate, anger, intrusive or recurrent disturbing thoughts, and sleep disturbances.28,29 SIGNS AND CAUSES OF BURNOUT IN MEDICAL NSMPS Burnout is a syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (i.e. cynicism), and a low sense of contribution to the work or mission.30 It is an occupational syndrome driven by the work environment. Burnout among health care NSMPs relates to their well-being, the quality of life of their patients, and caring effectiveness.31,32,4 Work-Related Causes Burnout related to occupation can be grouped into subcategories such as work process in efficiencies, workload, lack of connectedness with unit, unit climate, and toxic leadership to name a few.4,24,26,31,33,34 Highlighted below are some of the characteristics of these stressors.",

    "text": "Follow-up: The above service member (SM) has been diagnosed with a concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and will be following the TBICoE Progressive Return to Activity (PRA) Protocol throughout recovery. This process is unique in that the SM will progress at their own pace through the protocol but will have a scheduled follow-up with their provider every three days. Here are a few common questions related to concussions and this process: What is the PRA? The PRA is a six-step return to activity protocol. The earliest a SM can be returned to full duty after concussion is seven days. Following a gradual return to duty protocol has been shown to get SMs back to full duty safely and reduce long-term complications. What could happen if a SM returns to duty too soon? Returning a SM too soon places the SM and their unit at risk. Concussion can cause temporary disruption of mental and physical functioning, impairing reaction time, balance, marksmanship, etc. The SM should return to their primary care manager (PCM) and undergo a Return to Duty Screening before they may be returned to full duty. What is the average recovery time from concussion/mTBI? When can the SM go back to work? Most SMs fully recover from concussion. Recovery is different for each person, but most people are back to full duty in 2–4 weeks and will be treated solely by their PCM. However, some SMs may experience more severe symptoms that take longer to resolve and require a referral to a TBI Clinic or specialist. What does a SM do if there are new or worsening symptoms during the day? Stop the activity until symptoms resolve. Then, return to the previously tolerated stage for the remainder of the day. The next day, reevaluate symptoms and continue progression through the PRA. Contact the provider with any questions or concerns. How does a SM progress through the stages of the PRA? The SM must spend at least 24 hours in each stage. At the beginning of each day the SM should evaluate how they feel: ■If symptoms are the same or better compared with the previous day AND they have no new symptoms — they can move on to the next stage ■If symptoms are worse compared with the previous day OR they have new symptoms – they remain at the current stage for an additional 24 hours What are common concussion symptoms?

    "text": "        Mesenteric Volvulus Mesenteric volvulus (MV) is a rapidly progressive and often fatal condition in which intestinal rotation devel­ ops around the root of the mesentery. Although rare, it appears to be increasing in frequency in MWDs.3 The case fatality rate was 92% in a recent report of 54 MWDs with MV; of these 24% were found dead and 76% were identified antemortem, and only 14% of the 126 reported cases have survived.3 Rapid recognition is necessary to afford MWDs a chance at survival. • In MV, the cranial mesenteric blood vessels and branches obstruct due to rotation, causing ischemic necrosis of the aborad duodenum, all the jejunum, ileum and cecum, ascending and transverse colon, and orad descending colon. • Death is due to rapidly progressive vascular obstruction, intestinal anoxia, shock, endotoxemia, and cardiovascular failure.3 • Statistical analysis of MV in 54 MWDs3 suggests key risk factors include German shepherd breed, age, prophylactic gastropexy or other abdominal surgery, history of gastrointestinal disease, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and increased humidity on the day of occurrence. Clinical Signs and Imaging Findings Suggesting MV • Peracute-to-acute onset of vomiting, mild abdominal distension, and shock. • Hemorrhagic diarrhea with or without tenesmus. • Intense abdominal pain on palpation. • Rapidly progressive deterioration in clinical presentation. • Extreme gas distension of the majority of the small and large bowel (See Figure 42 below).

    "text": "   CHAPTER 18 Canine Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) Background MWDs exposed to different types of intense external stimuli, such as explosions and gunfire, experience a syndrome that is similar to PTSD in people. While much remains unknown about this syndrome, most of the affected MWDs to date have been exposed to these stimuli in combat scenarios. Thus, it is reasonable that MWD handlers will seek medical guidance for acutely affected dogs from HCPs. It is essential to be aware of this syndrome and to effectively guide handlers in immediate care while working to evacuate affected dogs to veterinary facilities. Veterinary Corps Officers are the best resource for current diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations and will facilitate telemedicine consultation with experts at the DoD Military Working Dog Veterinary Service. High Index of Suspicion Maintain high index of suspicion based on antecedent events. HCPs should maintain a high index of suspicion for C-PTSD so as to identify potential MWDs for further evaluation. Inclusionary criteria in the immediate period include antecedent events, specifically any combination of the following: • Concussive event (with or without physical injury) • Exposure to a combat environment, and • Prolonged or repeated deployment to combat zone. Key Behavioral Signs Characteristic for C-PTSD Specific behavioral signs are tip-offs that C-PTSD may be present. HCPs will need to rely on the MWD handler for information about these signs. Signs include any combination of the following: escape or avoidance from work-related environments, in­ creased or decreased reactivity to environmental or social stimuli, positive or negative changes in rapport with the handler, or interference with critical tasks (detection, controlled aggression, and obedience). NOTE: Possible delayed onset or delayed reporting of clinical signs supporting C-PTSD is common. Although MWD handlers will most likely seek guidance after acute onset of signs, HCPs should be aware some MWDs may not manifest obvious signs for some time, or handlers may not seek guidance until the syndrome is advanced. Additionally, some dogs will have been evaluated, with treatment initiated by veterinary person­ nel, with handlers seeking guidance some time later. Thus, other keys to C-PTSD for HCPs to be aware of are the continuance of behavioral signs for more than 30 days and failure to improve with time or treatment. C-PTSD 97",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel training, the number of members trained and the type of training received varies by service. Additional description of self‐aid and buddy aid capability in the present as well as modifications that might enhance the capability in the future are provided below. Leadership actions include removing or adjusting duties required by individual service members based on guidance from medical personnel. There are some basic models for preventive care, including the ability to rest and recover, which are often dictated by leadership and mission. Commanders and other leaders are also able to employ unit‐wide assessments and tailor their decisions based on that information. Behavioral health and other medical personnel often become the primary educators and consultants to command on how to respond to individual and unit‐level mental health concerns. SELF‐AID The changing nature of conflict will result in an increase in the behavioral health stress faced by troops on the battlefield. With diminished reliance on battlefield circulation, troops will no longer be able to rely on external medical support, enhancing the need for real‐time self‐management of behavioral health stress and distress. A primary domain through which self‐aid may be implemented is with the increased use of mobile applications for the self‐management of behavioral health symptoms in military settings. Many of these apps (e.g., Breathe2Relax, Virtual Hope Box, PTSD Coach) have undergone rigorous empirical evaluations and have been found to be effective for self‐management of symptoms 13,14 and may be appropriate for use in deployed settings 15 Importantly, many of the mobile applications which have been developed specifically for use in military populations have already addressed critical domains, such as the use of data‐at‐rest encryption, the ability to be pre‐loaded onto devices, and standalone capacity or no need for reliance on consistent internet access.16 Additional training for the enhancement of self‐aid may come through updating existing training which is already in use for the enhancement of psychological well‐being and resilience, in order to reflect the changing nature of conflict. One such initiative is Master Resilience Training (MRT).17 MRT has been implemented into the force for the past decade and aims to develop upon an individual’s natural resiliency and capability for stress management.18 Although MRT has been found to be effective in both the short‐ and long‐term,18,19 the training will need to be updated to reflect the unique stressors present in austere multi‐domain operations (MDO) and prolonged field care (PFC) environments.18 Furthermore, preliminary investigations of stress inoculation training using simulated combat scenarios has shown mixed but promising results. Further development and widespread implementation of these trainings will allow troops to more readily self‐identify and briefly self‐treat their own behavioral health care in real time. BUDDY AID In conjunction with an increased expectation for troops to engage in self‐aid, buddy intervention will be similarly essential in addressing acute stress reactions. Peaks in behavioral evacuations frequently precede or follow a significant operational event.20 Buddy aid may be trained to and applied by any available troop and will serve to increase the availability of immediate interventions. Two well‐supported uses of buddy interventions for acute stress reactions are the Israeli Defense Forces intervention YaHaLOM21 and the U.S. forces adaptation, iCOVER22, which are further described in Chapter 4. These are brief 30‐ to 60‐second procedures which are easily taught to and implemented at the squad level with a 90‐minute training and are associated with return to functioning during dangerous situations when implemented on front lines.23 Both YaHaLOM and iCOVER may be employed by any available troop, greatly increasing access to immediate buddy intervention.22 While YaHaLOM and iCOVER function to address immediate acute stress reactions, the Marine Corps OSCAR program trains select leaders to identify and assist Marines affected by chronic operational stress problems and requires that 20% of all unit members receive Operational Stress Control and Readiness (OSCAR) training. This program relies on the concept of buddy care through the promotion of early recognition of more chronic combat stress.24 More widespread use of iCOVER, Master Resilience Training, OSCAR, and related programs across branches will Chapter 1: Behavioral Health Assets Typically Available in the Deployed Environment 4",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel STRESS MANAGEMENT Most individuals under normal but stressful circumstances are able to cope with the stress load and return to functioning without adverse outcomes downrange. Potential impact and negative effects of stress can be mitigated through adaptive stress coping. The components of adaptive coping include the 5 Rs described below. 1. Reassurance of normality 2. Rest – break from combat or work 3. Replenish bodily needs – heat, water, food, hygiene, sleep 4. Restore confidence – with purposeful activities and unit contact 5. Return to duty and reunite with unit As indicated earlier, the overarching principles of interventions should follow a stepped approach as much as possible to ensure the lowest appropriate level of intervention for the presenting issue. At the minimum, stress reactions could be addressed by self or with help by peer by establishing “buddy” systems for informal support. Additionally, sources of support include chaplains, military police, and medics that can facilitate access to resources. Detailed description of behavioral health resources and self /buddy interventions are described in Chapter 1 as well as in the chapters 3 and 4, addressing behavioral health conditions. Leadership plays an important role in mitigating stress as well as promoting healthy behaviors. This is accomplished by creating an open culture free of stigma towards behavioral health conditions, leading by example e.g., reminding service members to care for themselves, and attending to basic needs including personal safety, hydration, sleep, and restoration as well as ensuring that service members are supported through stressors such as disciplinary action or relationship difficulties. Additional actions by leadership are detailed in the Chapter 6 on command consultation. Finally, described below is the overarching guidance on the stepped approach for minimum, better, and best interventions to address some of the behavioral health conditions that some of the service members might experience in a forward environment. Chapter 3 and 4 provide descriptions of the interventions tailored to specific conditions. MINIMUM, BETTER, BEST RATING Minimum: At a minimum, interventions for all behavioral health conditions should focus on safety management and de‐escalation of the crisis or presenting symptom. For example, when a service member is displaying symptoms of acute stress as evidenced by increased palpitations and panic, a peer or buddy could help by reassuring the service member, providing support, and ensuring that the service member is out of harm’s way. Better: Better than minimum interventions include actions taken to ensure the safety of the service member as well as provide help with stress management. Some of the approaches which are also described in detail in later sections of this guidance include tactical breathing, help with problem solving, etc. Best: The interventions identified as the best approach are tailored interventions for the presenting symptoms which have been described in detail in Chapters 3 and 4. In addition to helping the service member cope with stress, these interventions also help with managing the presenting problem by leveraging behavioral health resources where available.

The six‐item Rapid Mood Screener (See Appendix B for full screener) also evaluates possible bipolar disorder.21 The RMS asks about both manic and general bipolar features. Items measure daily functioning, specifically if mood or activity level are different from usual or are causing disruption within their unit. These items include:  Have you ever had to stop or change your antidepressant because it made you highly irritable or hyper?  Have you ever had a period of at least one week during which you were more talkative than normal with thoughts racing in your head?  Have you ever had a period of at least one week during which you felt any of the following: Unusually happy, unusually outgoing, or unusually energetic?  Have you ever had a period of at least one week during which you needed much less sleep than usual? MANIA AND BIPOLAR SYMPTOMS: RULE OUTS Mania: Mania is often identified as abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Manic patients can appear excessively friendly and talkative. Grandiose delusions are generally present regarding self‐worth or beliefs about one’s power and influence. A decreased need for sleep is present. Speech is pressured. Easy distractibility can be noted with a rapid flow of ideas, racing thoughts, and increased goal‐directed activities. Psychomotor agitation can appear as restless, constant movement.22 Manic patients are usually oriented to person, place, and time but some orientation impairment might be noted. Gross memory and cognition problems are also likely at intake. Manic patients can be threatening and assaultive. Insight is usually impaired, and they are highly unreliable in information provided about themselves and symptoms. These symptoms usually last one week and are present most of the day, nearly every day.22 Hypomania: A period of persistent abnormally elevated or irritable mood with increased goal‐directed behavior that lasts at least four full days. Three or more of the symptoms associated with mania are present. Hypomania likely does not cause significant occupational or social impairment as would be seen with mania.22 Major Depressive Episode: Low mood for at least two weeks and significant social and occupational impairment. Individuals will experience at least five of the following symptoms: low mood (e.g., feeling empty, hopeless), loss of interest in pleasurable activities, weight loss or gain, hyper or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, difficulty concentrating, suicidal ideation, feelings of guilt or worthlessness.22 Also evaluate:  Presence of suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent, or plan.  Access to means for harm to self or others.  Presence of command hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms.  Presence of alcohol or substance use.",

Medical personnel and the command team should ensure there is no access to the potential victim and means of harming others. The assessment should serve as an aid in making decisions in an operational environment, such as evaluating the need for law enforcement engagement (if any), the manner in which to execute administrative action, recommendations for victim security, and the appropriate type of management plan for dealing with the situation at hand. Threat assessments are neither intended nor suitable for inclusion in testimonial or evidentiary documents, nor are they a substitute for a thorough, comprehensive investigation.37 In addition, the evaluation should rule out potential suicide risk, as it is commonly co‐morbid with homicide risk. Please see the previous section regarding suicide risk for additional information. Subsequent management should then be determined after a thorough assessment of the variables.

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel MINIMUM, BETTER, AND BEST INTERVENTIONS Minimum: Use the 5 Rs, Basic Listening and Validation, Tactical Breathing Problem‐focused coping is generally preferred to emotion‐focused coping because it is associated with positive health outcomes.13,14 However, because of the lack of ability to directly mitigate psychosocial stressors in a deployed/forward environment, emotion‐focused coping strategies are a preferred front‐line intervention. These interventions are individually based and focus on the service member regulating her or his negative emotional reactions to a stressor.15 As indicated at the outset, the initial approach for management of behavioral health issues in forward environment should, at a minimum, include the 5 Rs, followed by additional strategies that are described in context of the case vignette. In the example of MAJ Morales, the commander, as well as peers, observed changes in the behavior of the service member. MAJ Morales also expressed feelings of distress. The first line of support for coping with psychosocial stress includes self‐help and “buddy” support. A few self‐care strategies that encourage adaptive coping that could be used by either a buddy or leader are described in the 5 Rs described below: • Reassurance of normality. • Rest – break from combat or work. • Replenish bodily needs – heat, water, food, hygiene, sleep. • Restore confidence – with purposeful activities and unit contact. • Return to duty and reunite with unit. Some of the most common self‐help, emotion‐focused coping strategies include reflective listening and help with de­ escalation of stress through use of techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing (“tactical breathing”), meditation, mindfulness, positive imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation. De‐escalation and Reflective Listening 1. Delimit Buddy or leader can use a series of verbal de‐escalation strategies including a “talk down” approach from the Safewards Model.16 The first step is to approach the service member and initiate a conversation to both provide support and to get a better understanding of the issue. Move to a quiet place and invite MAJ Morales to sit down. 2. Clarify • Return to duty and reunite with unit. • Ask what is happening using open‐ended questions. Example: “What’s upsetting you right now?” • Offer help and re‐orient the person to who you are, who they are, and where you are. Example: “I see you’re angry and maybe scared. I want to help. I am LT Johnson, the PA. We are at FOB XXX. We met before in the DFAC.” • Repeat back to the person what you heard to ensure accurate information and indicate that you are listening. Example: “I hear you saying that you think that you’re angry at your wife, and you think that she is out to get you. Is that right?” Chapter 4: Management of Most Common Behavioral Health Conditions That May Manifest in Forward Environments 6",

    "text": "Acute Behavioral Health Care by Non‐Specialty Medical Personnel Chapter 7: Behavioral Health Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) 4 Plan for Tailgate Medicine and Creative Strategies Especially in an austere environment, service members may experience long wait times or inability to evacuate as medically necessary. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss a variety of approaches to reduce stress and improve behavioral health functioning. Select Appropriate Escorts Commanders are responsible for providing appropriate escorts for medical evacuations. For behavioral health issues specifically, escorts must have certain traits and characteristics. In a far‐forward environment, there might be limitations with available personnel. Course Corrections Commanders should not select a NMA with known behavioral health concerns. At times, it might appear more efficient to send service members who experience behavioral health‐related readiness issues together. However, this strategy can lead to significant obstacles to safety planning. In the event that the NMA may present with physical and/or behavioral health concerns at any time throughout the escort process, he/she will need to advise command as well as the NSMP(s) in the event that the NMA will need to be switched out. Use Effective Communication Strategies for all Medical Evacuations Effective communication can lead to better health outcomes, including patients managing their emotions better, making more accurate assessments, and making better medical decisions.11,12 The Commander Understands their Role and Responsibilities Commanders must acknowledge and complete patient paperwork for all service members who have concerns that require higher echelon(s) and complete all medical documentation in advance of transportation for each service member. Command should be in direct contact with the higher role of care (ROC) to establish ongoing status of patient, concerns, etc. The ROCs must also communicate with command in a timely manner with regard to any status changes, concerns, etc. The Service Member Understands the Process Ensure that the service member understands that they are being medically evacuated and generally what to expect as they move through the process. If service members have behavioral health concerns, they may also be especially likely to experience deficits in processing information and understanding verbal information. To reduce distress and ensure a smoother transport, the NSMP should be intentional about using specific communication strategies to ensure the service member understands. Use Kind Words and Straightforward Language Remember that the medical evacuation may be positive news for some service members and negative news for others. NSMP: Our primary goal is that you and the unit remain safe. It has become clear that we need additional resources to support you. We are medically evacuating you, or transferring you, to another facility so that you can receive the support you need. What are your questions? Service member: I don’t think I have any. Back Brief NSMP: Okay. I need you to repeat back to me what I shared with you, just so I know we’re both on the same page. Where are you going next? Service member: To a different facility.",
