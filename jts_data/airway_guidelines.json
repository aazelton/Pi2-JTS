A provider of PFC first\nmust be an expert in TCCC. The intent of this guideline is to identify potential issues one must consider when\nproviding analgesia with or without seda tion for an extended time (i.e. 4– 72 hours). As a principle, the guideline\nattempts to decrease complexity by reducing options for monitoring, medications, and so forth. It prioritizes\nexperience with a limited number of options rather than providing recommendations about many different\noptions that can be used in a more customized way. It does not address induction of anesthesia  before airway\nmanagement (i.e. rapid sequence intubation). The CPG should be used by all  clinicians providing analgesia and\nseda tion in a Role 1 ( R1) or PFC environment.\nPRIORITIES  OF  CARE\nPriorities of care as related to analgesia and sedation:\n1.Keep the casualty alive. Do not give analgesia and/or sedation if there are other priorities of care (e.g.,hemorrhage control)\n.\n2.S\nustai n adequate physiology to maintain perfusion. Do not give medications that lower blood pressur e\no\nr suppress respiration if the patient is in hemorrhagic shock or respiratory distress (or is at significant\nrisk of developing either condition).\n3.Relieve pain. Give medications to treat pain first.\n4.Maintain safety. Agitation and anxiety may cause patients to do unwanted things (e.g., remove devices,fight, fall). Sedation may be needed to maintain patient safety.\n5.Stop awareness. During painful procedures, and during some mission requirements, amnesia may bedesired.\nPRINCIPLES\nIn an R1 or PFC setting, intravenous (IV) or interosseous (IO) medication delivery is preferred overintramuscular (IM) therapies. The IV/IO route is more predictable in terms of dose-respons\ne\nr\nelationship.\nRemember, you can always give more , but it is very difficult to take away. Therefore, it is easier to\nprevent cardiorespiratory depression by being patient and methodical. Titrate to  effect .\nSmaller, more frequent doses of medications are preferred to single large doses to achieve a constantlevel of pain control and sedation over a longer time.\nThe lower the blood volume, the less drug and time will be needed to achieve similar affects ascompared with a normovolemic patient. St art low,  go slow.\nEngage telemedicine support early and often if you are inexperienced in delivering analgesia a\nnd\ns\nedation beyond TCCC or if you are having difficulty.\nAnalgesia and Sedation Management During Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 61\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  3 PRINCIPLES   OF  MED ICATION   USE  IN  THE  PFC   SETTING\nComparative effectiveness data for one analgesia/sedation strategy versus another are lacking. The principles of\nmedication use in the PFC setting include:\n1.Consider pain in three categories:\na.Background: the pain that is always present because of an injury or wound. This should be managed\nto keep a patient comfortable at rest but should not impair breathing, circulation, or mental status.\nb.Breakthrough: the acute pain induced with movement or manipulation. This should be managed as\nneeded. If breakthrough pain occurs often or while at rest, background pain medication should b e\ninc\nreased.\nc.Procedural : the acute pain associated with a procedure. This should be anticipated and managed\nperiprocedurally.\n2.Analgesia is the alleviation of pain and should be the primary focus of using these medications. In other\nwords, treat pain before considering sedation. Remember, not every patient needs (or should receive)\npain medication at first, and unstable patients may require other therapies or resuscitation before the\nadministration of pain or sedation medications.\n3.Sedation is used to relieve agitation or anxiety and, in some cases, induce amnesia. The most common\ncauses of agitation are untreated pain or other serious physiologic problems like hypoxia, hypotension,\nor hypoglycemia. Sedation is used most commonly to ensure patient safety (e.g., when agitation is notcontrolled by analgesia and there is need for the patient to remain calm to avoid movement that mightcause unintentional tube, line, dressing, splint, or other device removal or to allow a procedure to beperformed) or to obtain patient amnesia to an event (e.g., forming no memory of a painful procedure orduring paralysis for ventilator management).\n4.Each patient responds  differently to medications, particularly with respect to dose. Some individuals\nrequire substantially more opioid, benzodiazepine, or ketamine; some require significantly less. Once\nyou have a “feel” for how much medication a patient requires, you can be more comfortable givin\ng\ns\nimilar amounts during redosing. In general, a single medication will achieve its desired effect if enough\nis given; however, the higher the dose, the more likely the side effects. Additionally, ketamine, opioids,\nand benzodiazepines given together have a synergistic effect: the effect of medications given together ismuch greater than a single medication given alone (i.e. the effect is multiplied, not added. Go with lessthan what you might normally use if each were given alone).\n5.PFC requires a different treatment approach than TCCC. Go slow, use lower doses of medication, titrate\nto effect, and redose more frequently. This will provide more consistent pain control and sedation. High\ndoses may result in dramatic swings between overse dation with respiratory suppression and\nhypotension alternating with agitation and emergence phenomenon.\nMONITORING\nPatients receiving analgesia and sedation require close monitoring for life -threatening side effects of medications.\nBest:  Portable monitor providing continuous vital signs display and capnography; document vital signs\ntrends frequently.\nBetter:  Capnography (if controlled airway) in addition to minimum requirements.\nMinimum:  Blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, pulse oximeter; document vital sign s trends.\nAnalgesia and Sedation Management During Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 61\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  4 MEDICATIONS\nNOTE:  Use the PFC Analgesia and Sedation Guideline table ( Appendix A ) for recommended treatments.\nKetamine drip recommendations are detailed in Appendix B .\nA “cheat sheet” of common IV medications is listed in Appendix C .\nProviders using these guidelines should be intimately familiar with the medications in Appendix D ,\nincluding their pharmacology, and sid e-effects.\nThe P\nFC Analgesia and Sedation Guideline table in Appendix A is arranged according to anticipated clinical\nconditions, corresponding goals of care, and the capabilities needed to provide effective analgesia and sedation\naccording to (1) the minimum standard, (2) a better option when mission and equipment support is available (all\nmedics should be trained to this standard), and (3) the best option that may only be available in the event a medic has had additional training and experience, and/or equipment is available. The table is i ntended  to be a\nquick reference guide but is not stand alone: you must also know the information in the rest of the guideline.\nMedications in the table are presented as either Give or Consider.\nGive:  Strongly recommended.\nConsider : Requires a complete assessment of patient condition, environment, risks, benefits,\nequipment, and provider training.\nStep 1. Identify the clinical condition.\nStandard analgesia  is for most patients. The therapies used here are the foundation for pain\nmanagement duri ng PFC. Expertise in dosing oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) and\naugmenting it with low dose ketamine IV or IO is a must.\nDifficult analgesia or sedation needed is for patients in whom standard analgesia does not achieve\nadequate pain control without suppressing respiratory drive or causing hypotension, OR when missionrequirements necessitate sedating a patient to gain control over his/ her actions to achieve patientsafety, quietness, or necessary positioning.\nProtected airway with mechanical  ventilation is for patients who have a protected airway and are\nreceiving mechanical ventilatory support or are receiving full respiratory support via assistedventilation (i.e., bag valve) .\nShock present  is for patients who have hypotension and shock.\nStep 2 . Read down the column to the row representing your available resources and training.\nStep 3. Provide analgesia/sedation medication accordingly.\nStep 4. Consider using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score ( Appendix F ) as a method to trend the\npatient’s sedation level.\nFor IV/IO drip medications:\n•Use normal saline to mix medication drips when possible, but other crystalloids (e.g., lactated Ringer’s,Plasmalyte, and so forth) may be used if normal saline is not available.\nDO NOT mix more than one medication in the same bag of crystalloid because this practice has notbeen studied and may not be safe. Mixing medications together, even for a relatively short time, may\nAnalgesia and Sedation Management During Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 61\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 cause changes to the chemical structure of one or both medications and could lead to toxic\ncompounds. There is ongoing research to determine the safety of such practices.\nIf a continuous drip is selected, use only a ketamine drip in most situations, augmented by push dos es\nof opioid and/or midazolam if needed. Multiple drips are difficult to manage and are generally notrecommended. Multiple drips should only be undertaken with assistance from a telemedicineconsultant with critical care experience. Multiple drips are most likely to be helpful in patients whoremain difficult to sedate with ketamine drip alone and can “smooth out” the sedation (i.e., fewer\npeaks and troughs of sedation with corresponding deep sedation mixed with periods of acut\ne\na\ngitation).\nREGIONAL  ANEST HESIA\n(Appendix E )\nRegional anesthesia (e.g., local anesthetic such as ropivacaine or lidocaine injected adjacent to a large, extremity\nnerve bundle or on either side of a finger or toe) is a useful technique that can markedly reduce or eliminate limb pain without risk of opioid or benzodiazepine side-effects of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. There are, however, serious potential morbidities (and mortality from proximal injections or injection directly into blood vessels) that may occur.\nFor these reasons, this guideline has attempted to balance the overall risks and potential benefits of this intervention by recommending optimal procedure technique (e.g., use of ultrasound),  a limited number of block\nsites, and the safest medication and dose combination. It should be noted that even with optimal technique, the\nrisk of systemic toxicity (e.g., seizure or cardiac arrest) is not eliminated. Toxicity occurs either with direct\ninjection of anesthetic into the systemic blood circulation or by absorption over the first 15 –20 minutes after\ninjection. Close monitoring MUST be available during this time.\nRegional anesthesia should only be used by trained individuals. There should be doc umentation of\ncompetency. Three techniques exist:\n1.Ultrasound-guidance:  used to visualize targeted nerves, needle placement, and the spread of local\nanesthetic in real time.\n2.Nerve stimulation:  requires an assistant, a nerve stimulator, specialized needles, and cannot be\nreliably applied in cases of partial or complete amputations, given the inability to elicit motor responsein severed muscles.\n3.Blind or anatomical technique:  should be reserved for distal nerve blocks only (i.e. fingers or toes).\nANALGESIA  AND   SEDATION  FOR   EXPECTANT   CARE  (I.E.  END - OF –LIFE   CARE)\nAn unfortunate reality of our profession, both military and medical, is that we encounter clinical scenarios that\nwill inevitably end in a patient’s death. In th ese situations, it is a healthcare provider’s obligation to give\npalliative therapy to minimize the person’s suffering. In these circumstances, the use of opioid analgesics and\nsedative medications is therapeutic and indicated, even if these medications wo rsen a patient’s vital signs (i.e.,\ncause respiratory depression and/or hypotension). If a patient is expectant:\nCall a telemedicine consult.\nPrepare to\nAnalgesia and Sedation Management During Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 61\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 Give opioid (morphine is preferred, but hydromorphone, fentanyl, or other opioid can be given) until the\npatient’s pain is relieved. If the patient is unable to communicate their pain, give opioid medication untilthe respiratory rate is less than 20/min.\nIf the patient com plains of feeling anxious (i.e.  is worrying about the future but not complaining of pain)\nor he cannot express himself but is agitated despite having a respiratory rate less than 20/min, give abenzodiazepine until the anxiety is relieved or the patient is sedated (i.e.  is not feeling anxious or is no\nlonger agitated).\nPosition the patient as comfortably as possible. Pad pressure points.\nProvide  anything that gives the patient comfort (e.g., water, food, cigarette).\nRelief of suffering, primarily through pain relief, is the goal during expectant care.\nCall a telemedicine consult to  discuss.\nREFERENCES\n1.Barr J, Fraser GL, Puntillo K, et al.

START LOW, GO SLOW.\n1Ketamine push (for pain): 20mg (range, 0.1– 0.2mg/kg) IV/IO every 10– 30 minutes PRN. If an IV/IO is not available, quadruple the ketamine dose to give 80mg IM (range, 0.4– 0.8mg/kg IM).\n2To identify the effective dose of pain or sedation medication, give the lowest dose every 2– 5 minutes until therapeutic target achieved or maximum dose is given. The effective dose is the amount required to achieve the desired effect (i.e., pain control or sedation). If\nunable to achieve target with maximum -dose opioid, add midazolam.\n• Hydromorphone 0.5mg (range, 0.25– 2mg) IV/IO every 1– 6 hours PRN (long acting, effective, fewest side-effects)\n• ALTERNATIVE opioid:\no Fentanyl 50μg (range, 25– 100μg) IV/IO every 30 minutes to 2 hours PRN (short acting, extremely fast onset, good for severe pain/procedures, greatest r isk of respiratory depression)\no Morphine 5mg (range, 2.5– 10mg) IV/IO every 1 –6 hours PRN (Long acting, more side-effects)\n• Midazolam 1mg (range, 0.5– 2 mg) IV/IO every 1– 6 hours PRN (sedation, amnesia)\n• Percocet 1– 2 tab PO every 4 hours PRN (slower onset but provides steady pain control for up to 6 hours ). Can supplement with effective dose of IV/IO opioids or ketamine for breakthrough pain. Contains 650mg acetaminophen. Do not exceed 4,000mg acetaminophen\nper day.\n3Ketamine loading dose (for sedation): 1mg/kg  IV push over 60 seconds, then drip for continuous sedation. See mixture and dosing tables in Appendix B . Ketamine may be used for either pain control or sedation, depending on the dose.\n4A continuous ketamine drip may take an hour to take full effect or wear off. Always start with a loading dose and augment with an effective dose of opioid and/or midazolam if additional sedation is needed. Increase or  decrease drip gradually.\n5If breakthrough pain occurs on ketamine drip, give an effective dose of opioid. If effective dose is needed twice in 1 hour, increase drip rate to next higher level. If no breakthrough pain in past 2 hours, decrease drip rate to  next lower level.\nNote: Consider using the RASS score as a method to trend the patient’s sedation level.

This applies to off -label\nuses with patients who are armed forces members.\nBACKGROUND\nUnapproved (i.e., “off -label”) uses of FDA-approved products are extremely common in American medicine and\nare usually not subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved drugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part of clinical trials, and in the military context, command require d,\nunapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved uses may also be subject to special regulations.\nADDITIONAL   INFORMATION  REGARDING   OFF -LABEL   USES   IN  CPGS\nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further,\nit does not imply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard of care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgm ent of\nthe responsible health care practitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship.\nADDITIONAL  PROCEDURES\nBalanced  Discussion\nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved\nby the FDA. Further, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that suggest caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA -issued\nwarnings.\nQuality   Assurance  Monitoring\nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance\nmonitoring of outcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.\nInformation  to  Patients\nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an\nunusual off -label use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be\ngiven to including in an appendix an appropriate information sheet for distributio n to patients, whether before\nor after use of the product. Information to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a DoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with such use."

A provider of PFC first \nmust be an expert in TCCC. The intent of this guideline is to identify potential issues one must consider when \nproviding analgesia with or without seda tion for an extended time (i.e. 4– 72 hours). As a principle, the guideline \nattempts to decrease complexity by reducing options for monitoring, medications, and so forth. It prioritizes \nexperience with a limited number of options rather than providing recommendations about many different \noptions that can be used in a more customized way. It does not address induction of anesthesia  before airway \nmanagement (i.e. rapid sequence intubation). The CPG should be used by all  clinicians providing analgesia and \nseda tion in a Role 1 ( R1) or PFC environment.  \nPRIORITIES  OF  CARE  \nPriorities of care as related to analgesia and sedation:  \n1.Keep the casualty alive. Do not give analgesia and/or sedation if there are other priorities of care (e.g.,hemorrhage control)\n.\n2.S\nustai n adequate physiology to maintain perfusion. Do not give medications that lower blood pressur e\no\nr suppress respiration if the patient is in hemorrhagic shock or respiratory distress (or is at significant\nrisk of developing either condition).\n3.Relieve pain. Give medications to treat pain first.\n4.Maintain safety. Agitation and anxiety may cause patients to do unwanted things (e.g., remove devices,fight, fall). Sedation may be needed to maintain patient safety.\n5.Stop awareness. During painful procedures, and during some mission requirements, amnesia may bedesired.\nPRINCIPLES  \nIn an R1 or PFC setting, intravenous (IV) or interosseous (IO) medication delivery is preferred overintramuscular (IM) therapies. The IV/IO route is more predictable in terms of dose-respons\ne\nr\nelationship.\nRemember, you can always give more , but it is very difficult to take away. Therefore, it is easier to\nprevent cardiorespiratory depression by being patient and methodical. Titrate to  effect .\nSmaller, more frequent doses of medications are preferred to single large doses to achieve a constantlevel of pain control and sedation over a longer time.\nThe lower the blood volume, the less drug and time will be needed to achieve similar affects ascompared with a normovolemic patient.

The principles of \nmedication use in the PFC setting include: \n1.Consider pain in three categories:\na.Background: the pain that is always present because of an injury or wound. This should be managed\nto keep a patient comfortable at rest but should not impair breathing, circulation, or mental status.\nb.Breakthrough: the acute pain induced with movement or manipulation. This should be managed as\nneeded. If breakthrough pain occurs often or while at rest, background pain medication should b e\ninc\nreased.\nc.Procedural : the acute pain associated with a procedure. This should be anticipated and managed\nperiprocedurally.\n2.Analgesia is the alleviation of pain and should be the primary focus of using these medications. In other\nwords, treat pain before considering sedation. Remember, not every patient needs (or should receive)\npain medication at first, and unstable patients may require other therapies or resuscitation before the\nadministration of pain or sedation medications.\n3.Sedation is used to relieve agitation or anxiety and, in some cases, induce amnesia. The most common\ncauses of agitation are untreated pain or other serious physiologic problems like hypoxia, hypotension,\nor hypoglycemia. Sedation is used most commonly to ensure patient safety (e.g., when agitation is notcontrolled by analgesia and there is need for the patient to remain calm to avoid movement that mightcause unintentional tube, line, dressing, splint, or other device removal or to allow a procedure to beperformed) or to obtain patient amnesia to an event (e.g., forming no memory of a painful procedure orduring paralysis for ventilator management).\n4.Each patient responds  differently to medications, particularly with respect to dose. Some individuals\nrequire substantially more opioid, benzodiazepine, or ketamine; some require significantly less. Once\nyou have a “feel” for how much medication a patient requires, you can be more comfortable givin\ng\ns\nimilar amounts during redosing. In general, a single medication will achieve its desired effect if enough\nis given; however, the higher the dose, the more likely the side effects. Additionally, ketamine, opioids,\nand benzodiazepines given together have a synergistic effect: the effect of medications given together ismuch greater than a single medication given alone (i.e. the effect is multiplied, not added. Go with lessthan what you might normally use if each were given alone).\n5.PFC requires a different treatment approach than TCCC. Go slow, use lower doses of medication, titrate\nto effect, and redose more frequently. This will provide more consistent pain control and sedation. High\ndoses may result in dramatic swings between overse dation with respiratory suppression and\nhypotension alternating with agitation and emergence phenomenon.\nMONITORING  \nPatients receiving analgesia and sedation require close monitoring for life -threatening side effects of medications.  \nBest:  Portable monitor providing continuous vital signs display and capnography; document vital signs\ntrends frequently.\nBetter:  Capnography (if controlled airway) in addition to minimum requirements.\nMinimum:  Blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, pulse oximeter; document vital sign s trends.\nAnalgesia and Sedation Management During Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 61 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  4 MEDICATIONS  \nNOTE:  Use the PFC Analgesia and Sedation Guideline table ( Appendix A ) for recommended treatments.  \nKetamine drip recommendations are detailed in Appendix B .\nA “cheat sheet” of common IV medications is listed in Appendix C .\nProviders using these guidelines should be intimately familiar with the medications in Appendix D ,\nincluding their pharmacology, and sid e-effects.\nThe P\nFC Analgesia and Sedation Guideline table in Appendix A is arranged according to anticipated clinical \nconditions, corresponding goals of care, and the capabilities needed to provide effective analgesia and sedation \naccording to (1) the minimum standard, (2) a better option when mission and equipment support is available (all \nmedics should be trained to this standard), and (3) the best option that may only be available in the event a medic has had additional training and experience, and/or equipment is available. The table is i ntended  to be a \nquick reference guide but is not stand alone: you must also know the information in the rest of the guideline.  \nMedications in the table are presented as either Give or Consider.  \nGive:  Strongly recommended.\nConsider : Requires a complete assessment of patient condition, environment, risks, benefits,\nequipment, and provider training.\nStep 1. Identify the clinical condition.  \nStandard analgesia  is for most patients. The therapies used here are the foundation for pain\nmanagement duri ng PFC. Expertise in dosing oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) and\naugmenting it with low dose ketamine IV or IO is a must.\nDifficult analgesia or sedation needed is for patients in whom standard analgesia does not achieve\nadequate pain control without suppressing respiratory drive or causing hypotension, OR when missionrequirements necessitate sedating a patient to gain control over his/ her actions to achieve patientsafety, quietness, or necessary positioning.\nProtected airway with mechanical  ventilation is for patients who have a protected airway and are\nreceiving mechanical ventilatory support or are receiving full respiratory support via assistedventilation (i.e., bag valve) .\nShock present  is for patients who have hypotension and shock.\nStep 2 . Read down the column to the row representing your available resources and training.  \nStep 3. Provide analgesia/sedation medication accordingly.  \nStep 4. Consider using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score ( Appendix F ) as a method to trend the \npatient’s sedation level.  \nFor IV/IO drip medications:  \n•Use normal saline to mix medication drips when possible, but other crystalloids (e.g., lactated Ringer’s,Plasmalyte, and so forth) may be used if normal saline is not available.\nDO NOT mix more than one medication in the same bag of crystalloid because this practice has notbeen studied and may not be safe. Mixing medications together, even for a relatively short time, may\nAnalgesia and Sedation Management During Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 61 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 cause changes to the chemical structure of one or both medications and could lead to toxic \ncompounds. There is ongoing research to determine the safety of such practices. \nIf a continuous drip is selected, use only a ketamine drip in most situations, augmented by push dos es\nof opioid and/or midazolam if needed. Multiple drips are difficult to manage and are generally notrecommended. Multiple drips should only be undertaken with assistance from a telemedicineconsultant with critical care experience. Multiple drips are most likely to be helpful in patients whoremain difficult to sedate with ketamine drip alone and can “smooth out” the sedation (i.e., fewer\npeaks and troughs of sedation with corresponding deep sedation mixed with periods of acut\ne\na\ngitation).\nREGIONAL  ANEST HESIA \n(Appendix E ) \nRegional anesthesia (e.g., local anesthetic such as ropivacaine or lidocaine injected adjacent to a large, extremity \nnerve bundle or on either side of a finger or toe) is a useful technique that can markedly reduce or eliminate limb pain without risk of opioid or benzodiazepine side-effects of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. There are, however, serious potential morbidities (and mortality from proximal injections or injection directly into blood vessels) that may occur.  \nFor these reasons, this guideline has attempted to balance the overall risks and potential benefits of this intervention by recommending optimal procedure technique (e.g., use of ultrasound),  a limited number of block \nsites, and the safest medication and dose combination. It should be noted that even with optimal technique, the \nrisk of systemic toxicity (e.g., seizure or cardiac arrest) is not eliminated. Toxicity occurs either with direct \ninjection of anesthetic into the systemic blood circulation or by absorption over the first 15 –20 minutes after \ninjection. Close monitoring MUST be available during this time.  \nRegional anesthesia should only be used by trained individuals. There should be doc umentation of \ncompetency. Three techniques exist:  \n1.Ultrasound-guidance:  used to visualize targeted nerves, needle placement, and the spread of local\nanesthetic in real time.\n2.Nerve stimulation:  requires an assistant, a nerve stimulator, specialized needles, and cannot be\nreliably applied in cases of partial or complete amputations, given the inability to elicit motor responsein severed muscles.\n3.Blind or anatomical technique:  should be reserved for distal nerve blocks only (i.e. fingers or toes).\nANALGESIA  AND   SEDATION  FOR   EXPECTANT   CARE  (I.E.  END - OF –LIFE   CARE)  \nAn unfortunate reality of our profession, both military and medical, is that we encounter clinical scenarios that \nwill inevitably end in a patient’s death. In th ese situations, it is a healthcare provider’s obligation to give \npalliative therapy to minimize the person’s suffering. In these circumstances, the use of opioid analgesics and \nsedative medications is therapeutic and indicated, even if these medications wo rsen a patient’s vital signs (i.e., \ncause respiratory depression and/or hypotension). If a patient is expectant:  \n Call a telemedicine consult.  \nPrepare to\n\nAnalgesia and Sedation Management During Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 61 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 Give opioid (morphine is preferred, but hydromorphone, fentanyl, or other opioid can be given) until the\npatient’s pain is relieved. If the patient is unable to communicate their pain, give opioid medication untilthe respiratory rate is less than 20/min.\nIf the patient com plains of feeling anxious (i.e.  is worrying about the future but not complaining of pain)\nor he cannot express himself but is agitated despite having a respiratory rate less than 20/min, give abenzodiazepine until the anxiety is relieved or the patient is sedated (i.e.  is not feeling anxious or is no\nlonger agitated).\nPosition the patient as comfortably as possible. Pad pressure points.\nProvide  anything that gives the patient comfort (e.g., water, food, cigarette).\nRelief of suffering, primarily through pain relief, is the goal during expectant care.\nCall a telemedicine consult to  discuss.\nREFERENCES \n1.Barr J, Fraser GL, Puntillo K, et al.

START LOW, GO SLOW.  \n1Ketamine push (for pain): 20mg (range, 0.1– 0.2mg/kg) IV/IO every 10– 30 minutes PRN. If an IV/IO is not available, quadruple the ketamine dose to give 80mg IM (range, 0.4– 0.8mg/kg IM).  \n2To identify the effective dose of pain or sedation medication, give the lowest dose every 2– 5 minutes until therapeutic target achieved or maximum dose is given. The effective dose is the amount required to achieve the desired effect (i.e., pain control or sedation). If \nunable to achieve target with maximum -dose opioid, add midazolam.  \n• Hydromorphone 0.5mg (range, 0.25– 2mg) IV/IO every 1– 6 hours PRN (long acting, effective, fewest side-effects)  \n• ALTERNATIVE opioid:  \no Fentanyl 50μg (range, 25– 100μg) IV/IO every 30 minutes to 2 hours PRN (short acting, extremely fast onset, good for severe pain/procedures, greatest r isk of respiratory depression)  \no Morphine 5mg (range, 2.5– 10mg) IV/IO every 1 –6 hours PRN (Long acting, more side-effects)  \n• Midazolam 1mg (range, 0.5– 2 mg) IV/IO every 1– 6 hours PRN (sedation, amnesia)  \n• Percocet 1– 2 tab PO every 4 hours PRN (slower onset but provides steady pain control for up to 6 hours ). Can supplement with effective dose of IV/IO opioids or ketamine for breakthrough pain. Contains 650mg acetaminophen. Do not exceed 4,000mg acetaminophen \nper day.  \n3Ketamine loading dose (for sedation): 1mg/kg  IV push over 60 seconds, then drip for continuous sedation. See mixture and dosing tables in Appendix B . Ketamine may be used for either pain control or sedation, depending on the dose.  \n4A continuous ketamine drip may take an hour to take full effect or wear off. Always start with a loading dose and augment with an effective dose of opioid and/or midazolam if additional sedation is needed. Increase or  decrease drip gradually.  \n5If breakthrough pain occurs on ketamine drip, give an effective dose of opioid. If effective dose is needed twice in 1 hour, increase drip rate to next higher level. If no breakthrough pain in past 2 hours, decrease drip rate to  next lower level.  \nNote: Consider using the RASS score as a method to trend the patient’s sedation level. See Appendix F . \nCall telemedicine consult if you are having difficulty managing pain or sedation.  \nAnalgesia and Sedation Management During Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 61 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9 APPENDIX   B:  KETAMINE  DRIP  DOSING  TABLES  \nKetamine drip (for sedation):  Sedation loading dose first (1mg/kg IV/IO over 60 seconds).  \nMIX:  750mg (1.5 vials of 500mg/5mL) in 250mL of normal saline (3mg/mL solution).  \nInitial drip dose:  \n• Best:  Using an IV pump, set to μg/kg/min dose desired.

This applies to off -label \nuses with patients who are armed forces members.   \nBACKGROUND  \nUnapproved (i.e., “off -label”) uses of FDA-approved products are extremely common in American medicine and \nare usually not subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved drugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part of clinical trials, and in the military context, command require d, \nunapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved uses may also be subject to special regulations.   \nADDITIONAL   INFORMATION  REGARDING   OFF -LABEL   USES   IN  CPGS  \nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, \nit does not imply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard of care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgm ent of \nthe responsible health care practitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship. \nADDITIONAL  PROCEDURES \nBalanced  Discussion  \nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved \nby the FDA. Further, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that suggest caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA -issued \nwarnings.  \nQuality   Assurance  Monitoring \nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance \nmonitoring of outcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored. \nInformation  to  Patients  \nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an \nunusual off -label use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be \ngiven to including in an appendix an appropriate information sheet for distributio n to patients, whether before \nor after use of the product. Information to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a DoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with such use.  \n",

A provider must first and foremost be an expert in TCCC , the Department of\nDefense standard of care for first responders. The intent of this PFC CPG is to provide evidence and experience -based solutions to those who manage airw ays in an austere environment. An emphasis is\nplaced on utilizing the tools and adjuncts most familiar to a Role 1 provider. The PFC capability of airway\nis addressed to reflect the reality of managing an airway in a Role 1 resource -constrained environment .\nA separate Joint Trauma System CPG will address mechanical ventilation. This PFC CPG also introduces\nan acronym to assist providers and their teams in preparing for advanced procedures, to include airway\nmanagement.\nBACKGROUND\nAirway compromise is the  second leading cause of potentially survivable death on the battlefield after\nhemorrhage.1  Complete airway occlusion can cause death from suffocation within minutes. Austere\nenvironments present significant challenges with airway management. Limited provider experience and\nskill, equipment, resources, and medications shape the best management t echniques. Considerations\ninclude: limited availability of supplemental oxygen; medications for induction/rapid sequence\nintubation, paralysis, and post -intubation management ; and limitations in available equipment. Another\nreality currently is limitations  in sustainment training options, especially for advanced airway\ntechniques. Due to these challenges, some common recommendations that may be considered “rescue”\ntechniques in standard hospital airway management may be recommended earlier or in a non-stand ard\nfashion to establish and control an airway in a PFC environment.  Patients who require advanced airway\nplacement tend to undergo more interventions, be more critically injured, and ultimately have a higher proportion of deaths.  The ability to rapidly and consistently manage an airway when indicated or  spend\ntime on other resuscitative needs when airway management is not indicated, may contribute to\nimproved outcomes.\n2,3\nINDICATIONS   FOR  AIRWAY  MANAGEMENT\nDISRUPTED   FACE   OR  NECK   ANATOMY\nIf managing an isolated injury  that disrupts face or neck anatomy , healthy adults may only need a\nmechanical airway placed and may not require assisted ventilation if they are not heavily sedated.  Examples of conditions requiring early airway management include:\n Massive facial trauma\n Burns to the face or inhalation injury with hoarseness or stridor\n Massive neck trauma\n Expanding neck mass/hematoma\n Acute pharyngeal infection (Retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, epiglottitis)\n Foreign body aspiration\n Anaphylaxis (airway swelling)\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  3 INSUFFICIENT  OXYGENATION  OR  VENTILATION\nThese indications may be apparent on initial evaluation or may emerge during the course of patient\nmanagement.  If the need to establish an airway develops more gradually, additional ele ctive airway\ntechniques can be employed.  Interventions such as prolonged manual bag or mechanical ventilation\nrequire an airway intervention to ensure best overall management.  Examples include:\n Chest wall and pulmonary trauma (blunt or penetrating) such as flail segments, pulmonary\ncontusions (from blast, blunt or crush mechanism)\n Burns with greater than 40% body surface area\n Traumatic brain injury with decreased level of consciousness (GCS ≤ 8)\n Traumatic brain injury with suspected herniation requiring hyperventilation (target ETCO 2\nbetween 30 and 35)\n Procedural sedation or surgical procedure\n Respiratory failure from disease, infection, or injury:\n Chemical or toxic inhalation injuries\n Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) from infection, massive res uscitation, drug-\ninduced or other causes\n Primary lung infection (pneumonia)\n Massive pulmonary embolism\n TRALI (transfusion related acute lung injury) or TACO (transfusion associated circulatory\noverload) due to massive transfusion\nTable 1.

In prepara tion for an advanced procedure (including\nsecuring an airway) using an acronym or other checklist approach will prove invaluable. One such\nacronym, originally developed as a simple pre -operative anesthesia checklist, is presented.\nThe MSMAID acronym ( Mach ine, Suction, Monitor, Airway, Intravenous access, Drugs) organizes an\napproach to preparation for airway management and may also prove useful in preparation for other\nprocedures.\nThe patient’s condition dictates the available time for a provider to consider all items on this checklist.\nA rapidly deteriorating patient with airway disruption or compromise will need the airway procedure first and follow -on considerations later. If a patient can be more appropriately classified as semi -urgent\n(e.g.,  worsening respiratory status due to an underlying pulmonary cause) the provider will have more\ntime to consider the algorithm and prepare. Logistic considerations, and sometimes considerable time\nconstraints, will affect preparation for advanced procedures. Recommendations follow the “minimum,\nbetter, best” format.\nMACHINE\n(Equipment required post -intubation)\n Minimum : Bag -Valve -Mask (BVM) with  positi ve end- expiratory pressure  (PEEP ) valve\n Better : Automated portable ventilator (preferably with PEEP); oxygen concentrator\n Best : Full-fe ature portable ventilator (e.g.  several ventilatory modes, PEEP); supplemental oxygen if\navailable\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 Managing v entilators or advanced equipment unfamiliar to a provider presents challenges.  Initiate\ntelemedicine consultation for best guidance.\nPEEP  is important for prolonged ventilation. PEEP is the pressure in the airway at the end of the\nexpiratory phase which prevents the alveoli of the lung from completely collapsing.  In a spontaneously\nbreathing person, this pressure is maintained by closing the glottis, clearing the throat, coughing,\nsighing, etc. With an invasive airway, the glottis is bypassed with the tube and “natural” PEEP is lost.  PEEP should therefore be introduced into the ventilated patient using a PEEP valve on the BVM or using the PEEP setting on a ventilator. When using BVM or ventilator, provide PEEP (recommended initial setting is 5 cm H2O).\n6\nSUCTION\nMinimum : Improvised suction (i.e. syring e + nasopharyngeal airway [NPA])  and patient pos itioning if\nnot contraindicated\nBetter : Manual suction bulb with adapter\nBest : Powered commercial suction with oral tip and in-line endotracheal tube suction adap ter\nSuction should be available when establishing and maintaining an airway to remove excessive secretions or blood. It is particularly important to utilize suction to facilitate view of the vocal cords during\nendotracheal intubation. In addition, suction should be available for routine patient care and\nmaintenance requirement for any intubated patients. Suction should be utilized as needed to remove secretions, mucous or blood from the airway device or oropharynx. In the event of high air way\npressures, suctio n may be used to remove mucus/mucus plugs  or to clear obstructions. In the case of\nthick secretions, a saline flush of 1 -2 mL followed by in -line suctioning of the endotracheal tube may be\nuseful.\nNote:  During in-line suctioning of tubes, the suction should only be applied when withdrawing the\ncatheter and not upon initial insertion.\nMONITOR\n(Monitor ing and telemedicine support )\nMinimum : Pulse oximeter (SpO2), assistant to monitor respirations and record manual vital signs.\nTren ding vital signs documentation. PFC flow sheet is recommended. Refer to PFC Documentation\nCPG.7  Voice or data connections to perform telemedicine communica tion\nBetter : Portable Capnometry (ETCO 2)/capnography in addition to SpO2.  Transmit photographs fro m\ns\nmartphones or personal devices to augment telemedicine communications .\nBest : Automatic vital signs monitor with SpO2, ETCO 2/waveform capnography,\n+/- elec trocardiogram (EKG);  Synchronous (real -time continuous) telemedicine using video or\nremote patient monitoring systems\nMonitoring is the active process of assessing the patient throughout a procedure. It involves the gathering, documenting and interpretation of vital signs and other data, and the continuous assessment of their clinical status. Telemedicine can be an important adjunct and critical capability to employ when monitoring a patient undergoing complex procedures.\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 AIRWAY\nMinimum : Medic is prepared for a ketamine cricothyroidotomy .\nBetter : Add ability to provide continuous sedation .\nBest : Add a responsible rapid -sequence intubation capability (to include chemical paralysis) with\nairway maintenance (to include suction) and continuous sedati on.\nPer the PFC Capabilities Position Paper , a definitive airway requires control of the patient’s  airway with\nan inflated cuff in the trachea. In addition, sedation is needed to keep the patient comfortable and\nsustain the airway.8\nA proposed algorithm was developed by Mabry RL et al  for an awake surgical airway (Figure 1) .9  This\nalgorithm incorpora tes the skills recommended for Tactical Combat Casualty Care and presents the\ndecision process deemed adequate (minimum standard) for definitive airway control in PFC.  The airway\nalgorithm is presented in its published form and surgical airway is synonymous with cricothyrotomy.  As noted above, the indications for surgical airway include disrupted face or neck anatomy, as well as a\nneed for prolonged positive pressure ventilation in a resource constrained PFC environment.  Consider\ntemporizing, if possible, with basic airway maneuvers or other airway adjuncts (e.g.; NPA, SGA).  Please see Table 1\n.\nFigure 1.

Adapted with permission from the Wilderness Medical Society. ©2017 Wilderness Medical Society.\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 Positioning of the patient to h elp clear airway obstruction should be considered first, when possible.\nThe simple option of placing the patient in a sitting position, placing the patient in the lateral “recovery”\nposition, or head tilt -chin lift/jaw thrust maneuver may be enough to ens ure adequate respirations.\nSimple adjuncts such as a nasal or oropharyngeal airway (in an unconscious patient) may be utilized in\naddition to proper positioning to help ensure a clear airway.\nFor those patients requiring active airway assistance, the firs t step should be inserting an NPA to open\nthe airway. BVM  ventilation is the next step in the algorithm and though it appears to be relatively\nsimple, the procedure requires preparation, training and skill to perform correctly. A spontaneously\nbreathing pa tient may prove challenging, but properly delivered, synchronous breaths may be the only\nrequirement to assist a patient’s respirations. Care should be taken to ensure proper volume and  rate of\nbag-delivered breath. One hand should provide moderate pressur e to the bag for no more than 50% of\nthe volume of an adult bag  or just enough to see the chest begin to rise at a rate of 12-16 breaths per\nminute (one breath every 4 -5 seconds) initially. It is important to avoid hyperventilation through large or\nrapid b reaths, particularly with traumatic brain injury ( TBI) casualties, therefore ETCO 2 monitoring is\nindicated for all patients requiring assisted ventilation and all patients with altered mental status (including both TBI casualties and sedated patients). BVM  is an important airway management skill (see\nAppendix C: Bag-Valve -Mask Technique\nfor a detailed description).  It is highly recommended that all\nPFC training on airway skills cover BVM skills  and techniques.\nOP and SGA insertion can present a considerable noxious stimulus and may not be tolerated by\nconscious or even some semiconscious patients.  Additionally, the dyssynchronous use of BVM\nventilation may lead to poor patient cooperation, abno rmal tidal volumes, gastric insufflation (and\nresultant regurgitation/aspiration), or other complications.\nThe decision to perform a cricothyroidotomy is one that is sometimes difficult.  When possible, in\nurgent but not emergency situations, a telemedici ne call should be considered to help with medical\ndecision making.\nAn important adjunct to passing an endotracheal tube, either via the cricothyroid membrane or the oropharynx, is the use of a gum elastic bougie (sometimes also referred to as an Eschmann S tylet or,\nsimply bougie).  This device is simple, rugged and should be used to guide tube placement.  The bougie\nis placed in the trachea before the endotracheal tube and may be used first to confirm proper\npositioning by either tactile discrimination (fee ling the tube bump against the tracheal rings on\nintroduction), or by encountering a hard stop when abutted against the carina.  An endotracheal tube is\nthen introduced over the bougie into the trachea.  Lastly, the bougie is removed.  A bougie may also be\nused to change tubes in the case of a tube malfunction.  This may be accomplished by placing a bougie\nin a tube that is currently positioned, remove the tube over the bougie (ensuring the bougie remains in\nthe proper position within the airway lumen), and  replacing a new tube over that bougie.  Remove the\nbougie, leaving the new tube in place.  Confirmation procedures discussed below must be repeated once the new tube is in place.\nConsistent with TCCC guidelines, the routine use of orotracheal intubation i s not recommended as the\nminimum standard in PFC.  This procedure requires con siderable skill and sustainment ;\n10 and requires\nappropriate sedation for both rapid sequence intubation and post -intubation management.  If a\nprovider is appropriately trained, c urrent  and practiced in the procedure, and has the required support\nequipment and medications, then orotracheal intubation may be considered.  Although preferred when\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 possible, training in orotracheal intubation is not required to obtain a definitive airway in the PFC\noperational setting. Consider basic measures first before proceeding to either type of invasive airway.  Additional details on orotracheal intubation are included in the JTS Airway CPG\n.\nAirway management in the tactical setting requires a different conceptual approach than airway\nmanagement in the hospital, or even the civilian prehospital environment.  Differences in epidemiology,\ninjury patterns, equipment and environment must be consid ered if airway management is to be\noptimized.  First, most military casualties requiring a prehospital airway have trauma to the head, face\nor neck.  Surgical airway is often the final common pathway due to bleeding or distorted anatomy.  In\ncomparison, mo st airways in the civilian prehospital environment are placed in elderly people for\ncardiac arrest.  When reliable suction and oxygen delivery are not available, or personnel are not\nexperienced in rapid sequence intubation using neuromuscular blockade, a definitive airway will often mean a surgical airway.\nProper   Tube  P lacement\nMinimum : Visualization of the tube passing through the vocal cords (in the case of endotracheal\nintubation); auscultation of epigastric region (should be silent) and bilateral lung sounds (should b e\np\nresent).  Colorimetric capnography + endotracheal detection device (EDD).  Easy bilateral rise a nd\nf\nall of the chest + misting of the tube + no signs of gastric insufflation. (Reassess frequently and have\nanother medic double check if  unsure.)\nBetter : Minimum plus portable capnometer.  Ultrasound if trained/available to guide and/or verif y\npla\ncement\nBest : Continuous ETCO 2/waveform capnography\nVerification of correct tube placement must be performed every time as incorrect tube placem ent may\nbe fatal .  The REACH study5 showed that right mainstem and hypopharynx placement are the most\ncommon locations of incorrect placement of ETT.  Esophageal intubation is also common.  Subcutaneous\nplacement of cricothyroidotomy tube may occur.  Use c apnography to verify correct tube placement as\ntube misplacement can be fatal.  Auscultate, if possible, to verify bilateral breath sounds. If ultrasound is\navailable, this can be used to further verify placement in the correct position.11\nIV/IO   ACCESS\nMinimum : If (IV) / intraosseous (IO) attempts fail or when unavailable: medication may be given\nintramuscularly or intranasally for immediate sedation to facilitate surgical cricothyroidotomy .\nCo\nntinue attempts at IV/IO access after airway has been contr olled\nBetter : 1-2 patent IV/IO\nBest : 2-3x patent i ntravenous IV/IO  with additional IO device on standby\nThough an important consideration to administer medications and fluids, do not delay an emergent airway to obtain IV/IO access in the instance you are the sole provider.\nUltrasound may be used to help identify small or deep veins.  Ultrasound guided IV ac cess may be\nattempted if trained.  Other sites to consider for superficial IV attempts include the external jugular and saphenous veins.  If appropriately trained, consider central venous access or venous cutdown.\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9 DRUGS\nAirway  Placement\nMinim um: Local anesthetic for cricothyroidotomy (superficial skin anesthesia plus 1 -2 mL injected\nthrough the cricothyroid membrane); or placement without medications in unconscious patient .\n**No\nte: most sedating agents can be given IM if IV/IO has not been es tablished\nBetter : Any IV/ IO sedating agent (opioid, benzodiazepine: reference the Analgesia and Sedation\nManagement for PFC CPG  for procedural doses of such  agents) .12\nBest : Procedural dose ketamine (1 -2 mg/kg IV push) for ETT or cricothyroidotomy placement + local\nanesthetic (lidocaine) for cricothyroidotomy placement\nProlonged  Sedation\n(post-airway placement)\nMinimum  (without IV  access ): Ketamine (sedation dose), 3-4mg/kg  IM\nBetter : IV/IO pushes of ketamine, opioid, and/or midazolam (alone or in combination as per th e\nindiv\nidual’s scope of practice, experience and availability of medications)\nBest : Ketamine IV/IO Drip. Hydromorphone or alternate opioid IV/IO push for breakthrough pain\nand midazolam IV/IO push as needed for sedatio n\n(\nReference Analgesia and Sedation Management  in PFC CPG for details and drug doses ).12\nBe cautious with sedation, advanced airway placement and positive pressure ventilation in patients\nwho are hypotensive or under -resuscitated.  Blood pressure can fall rapidly during airway managemen t\ndue to a variety of mechanisms.\nIn all cases, monitor BP closely (every 1 -2 minutes during the procedure, every 3 -5 minutes for\n15 minutes post-procedure).  A BP drop may be brief (if due to vagal effects of epiglottis stimulation\nduring ETT placement) or sustained (due to positive pressure ventilation, increased intrathoracic\npressure and decreased venous return to the heart). Loss of sympathetic drive secondary to pain and sedation medications, and/or continued hypovolemia can also result in hypotension. Continue resuscitation with blood products (trauma patients) or crystalloid (non -trauma patients) if a hypotensive\npatient requires immediate airway interventions. Be prepared to support blood pressure with vasopressors (e.g. epinephrine bolus or drip) if trained or under direct telemedicine guidance.\nNeuromuscular blockade (succinylcholine, rocuronium, vecuronium, etc.) is NOT recommended for use\nby the average practitioner of PFC . Though these are standard medications to use in rapid sequence\nintubatio n and ventilator management, their potential lethality in inexperienced hands does not justify\nroutine recommended use. If trained and/or under direct supervision of telemedicine support, the use of neuromuscular blockade may be considered, subject to local medical direction and protocols.\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  10 PERFORMANCE   IMPROVEMENT   (PI)  MONITORING\nPOPULATION  OF  INTEREST\n1.

Increased moisture on inspiration helps maintain\nalveolar moisture. Capnography should not be positioned in -line following HME as these moisture\ndevices can increase breathing resistance and w ork of respiration, as well as increase breathing\napparatus dead space (especially in pediatric patients). This may lead to potential worsening\nhypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. Recommended order: endotracheal tube -capnograph -HME device\n(proximal to d istal) .\nNASOGASTRIC/OROGASTRIC TUBE:\nPlacement of a nasogastric (NG) or orogastric (OG) tube should be considered following intubation of a patient in order to decompress gastric contents, prevent aspiration and gastric distention.\n If only supraglottic a irway access is available, consider using a supraglottic device that incorporates\nan orogastric tube port.\n Always measure the distance from nose to stomach and note the distance prior to insertion, then verify epigastric sounds. Verify placement with sec ond practitioner if sounds are questionable or\ndifficult to auscultate.\n Do not feed, aggressively hydrate or give oral medications through an OGT or NGT without telemedicine guidance. Always reassess tube position prior to putting anything into stomach to\nensure proper gastric placement. Feeding should not be considered until 72 hours after injury in the\nPFC environment. If volume instilled is too large or rate is too fast, there is increased risk for\nvomiting. If feeding or hydration is begun th rough an OGT or NGT, they must be accurate,\nmeasured, and monitored.

Masks should be of the proper size and should be fitted to the\nface to obtain a seal. This is best achieved by first placing the tapered portion of the opening of the mask\nover the bridge of the nose, then covering the patient’s mouth. If using the one -person method, the\nnon-dominant had should use the “C & E” method with the thumb and index finger forming a C to cover\nthe mask, and the middle, ring and small fingers forming an E on the bone of the mandible effectively\nlifting the jaw into the mask (rather than pressing the mask onto the face).\nThe other hand should gently squeeze the bag delivering a breath at a rate of one squeeze every 5 -6\nseconds. There should not be a leak around the mask, and you should be able to observe the rise and\nfall of the patient’s chest. An ETCO 2 monitor may be placed in -line with the bag and mask. PEEP should\nbe used with the BVM and initially set to 5mmHg. Every  attempt should be made to maintain a seal to\nensure continued PEEP.  If the patient is breathing spontaneously, careful observation and delivery of an assisted synchronous breath should be a priority.\nSome additional considerations are below:\n1. If unable t o perform adequate single hand C & E clamp, use two handed technique with a\nsecond person to bag.\n2. Don’t press mask down onto face when performing C & E clamp, visualize you are lifting face\ninto mask.\n3. Be aware fingertips on “E -clamp” should be positioned on the bones of the mandible and not on\nsoft tissue, which could possibly occlude the airway.\n4. Use “BOOTS” to predict difficult face- mask seals: Bearded, Obese, Old, Toothless, Snoring. In\naddition, maxillofacial trauma and edema from burns may prevent eff ective ventilation by BVM.\n5. NPA should be used to assist with face mask ventilations (unless obvious contraindications such as mid -face trauma). OPA are also effective in obtunded patients or those who have received\nchemical sedation or neuromuscular blockade.\n6. For bearded patients, lubrication of mask may assist seal. Tegaderm occlusive dressings over\nbeard may also help if available. (If Tegaderm is used in sedated patient, consider pulling off\nbefore medication wears off, to lessen pain).\n7. Consider mask st raps to make face -mask seal more \"hands free\", especially if a non-medic is\nassisting you with BVM .\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  19 APPENDIX D: SUPRAGLOTTIC AIRWAY PLACEMENT\nSUPRAGLOTTIC AIRWAY (SGA) PLACEMENT CHECKLIST\n\u0000 Open airway manually, measure and insert simple airway adjunct (NPA -or - OPA) .\n\u0000 Ventilate patient with bag -valve -mask (BVM ) (attach supplemental oxygen, if available) .\n\u0000 If ventilations insufficient, or the patient is clearly unconscious and not breathing adequately,\nprepare for supraglottic airway inserti on.

Follow MSMAID and for induction, use ketamine (1mg/kg IV/IO or 3 -4mg/kg IM) if time permits\nand the medication is available.\nFor awake cricothyrotomy: Explain procedure to patient; *Use local anesthesia: lidocaine (1% or 2%),\nbupivacaine (0.25%, 0.5% or 1%); local through planned incision area AND approx. 1 -2mL through\ncricothyroid membrane\nPERFORM PROCEDURE\n1. Stabilize thyroid cartilage and keep overlying skin taught.  Maintain control with hand until the\nmembrane incision is secured (step 8 below) .\n2. Locate cricothyroid membrane (Palpate for hyoid  and tracheal rings. If unsure or difficult\nlandmarks, then measure three finger widths above sternal notch for adults) .\n3. Make vertical incision through the skin over cricothyroid membrane.\n4. Make horizontal incision through cricothyroid membrane, then immedi ately:\n5. Open and maintain membrane incision with tracheal hook (or curved hemostat, bougie or blunt\nend of scalpel).\n6. Insert endotracheal/tracheostomy tube into opening and direct tube caudad into trachea until\nthe balloon is just inside the airway.\n7. Inflat e cuff and detach syringe (palpate bulb to ensure it’s not under -inflated or over -inflated) .\n8. Maintain control of tube at all times to prevent dislodgement .\n9. Attach waveform capnography, or capnometry, or colorimetric device to confirm proper placement of t ube.\n10. Being careful not to dislodge the tube, attach BVM with PEEP and further check placement\n(epigastric and bilateral chest) and adequacy of bilateral insufflation of lungs.\n11. Remove BVM (if sufficient respiratory effort), assess respirations for adequacy  (rate, rhythm,\nand quality), assist ventilations if needed.\n12. Secure with sutures and tie with girth hitch passed around the neck if time permits. As a stopgap, may use chest seal or secure around the neck with tie, ensuring inflation bulb does not\nget caught.\n13.

A patient w ith a\ncricothyroidotomy may not require heavy continuous sedation.\n\u0000 Raise the head and torso to 30 - 45°\n\u0000 Filter and humidify the air with a heat moisture exchanger. Place HME in-line distal to EtCO\n2\ndevice.\n\u0000 As needed, place in -line suction for the tube, and suction the mouth for any excess secretions\n\u0000 Check cuff pressure (palpate bulb –  should be moderately firm but still compressible)\n\u0000 Place orogastric tube, if available.\n\u0000 Put a BVM +PEEP valve at the bedside if using a mechanical ventilator.\n\u0000 Deconta minate the mouth with chlorhexidine swab or toothbrush without paste as per the\nnursing care plan.\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  22 APPENDIX G: WAVEFORM CAPNOGRAPHY &  PULSE OXIMETRY INTERPRETATION\nWAVEFORM CAPNOGR APHY (END TIDAL CO2 (ET CO 2))\nAND PULSE OXIMETRY (SPO2) INTERPRETATION\nDetection of E TCO2 is the most reliable way to continuously monitor ventilation and therefore confirm\nplacement of an advanced airway (the only exception is during CPR when ETCO 2 may be undetectable).\nWaveform capnography is the preferred method to detect ETCO 2, and with th e development of small,\nportable devices, is the recommended technique even in austere field environments. Inexpensive\ncolorimetric CO 2 detectors are available, however the color change method may be very difficult to\nvisualize with poor lighting or night vision devices.  Waveform capnography measures the end -tidal\ncarbon dioxide that passes through the device as the patient exhales in real time since it is placed directly in- line with the endotracheal tube. ETCO\n2 may also be attached to a face mask to verif y normal\nand spontaneous breaths if  an advanced airway has not been placed. With most portable, field\ncapnographs, a number in mmHg will be appear on the display, which indicates the value of the CO 2 in\nthe exhaled breath and can be an immediate confirmati on of correct tube placement. If the airway was\nplaced correctly, and the patient is ventilating normally, the capnograph should read between\n35-45 mmHg. Some other examples include:\n ETCO 2 = 0: the tube is not transmitting any CO 2: disconnected, tube plac ed in wrong position or has\nbecome dislodged.  This may also occur if the patient is dead and there is no gas exchange.\n ETCO 2 <35: Hyperventilation. The most common cause is over -bagging the patient, but may also\nindicate pain or anxiety. The only indicati on for “induced” hyperventilation is severe traumatic brain\ninjury with signs of acute herniation, GOAL = 30 -35 (no less than 30)\n ETCO 2 >45: Retaining CO 2, ineffective ventilation may indicate oversedation, primary lung problem,\nbrain injury, worsening obs tructive disease (asthma).  If the trend is rising, this is an indicator of\nneed for active ventilation assistance (BVM or mechanical ventilator)\nDuring CPR (as an indicator of effectiveness of chest compressions and return of circulation):\n ETCO 2 < 10: there is no return of CO 2 to the lungs (no effective circulation).  If CPR is initiated, it is\nineffective\n ETCO 2 = 10 -20: EFFECTIVE CPR\n ETCO 2 = 40 OR GREATER: You may see an abnormally high CO 2 reading immediately after return of\nspontaneous circulation (ROSC), for instance after a successful defibrillation or return of effective cardiac activity.\nMonitor that can provide waveform capnography can provide much more insight into a patient’s\nventilation and oxygenation status. A quick reference to the most common waveforms is helpful to\nunderstanding the status of a patient.\nPulse oximetry is also of use in monitoring the oxygenation status of a patient. It can be an indirect\nmeasure of oxygen deliv ery to the tissues, and overall pulmonary function.  Pulse oximetry monitors\noxygenation by measuring absorbance differences between oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin\nthrough the use of an infrared light. Pulse oximetry, however, has some important key limitations. A\npulse oximetry reading indirectly reflects the patient’s central (pulmonary) oxygenation status by\nmeasuring the peripheral oxygenation. This means that any intervention that addresses oxygenation in\nthe lungs may not be detected by the pulse o ximeter until 30 -90 seconds after the intervention.\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  23 Additionally, if the patient is suffering from carbon monoxide or some other forms of poisoning, the\npulse oximetry may read inaccurately. Also, a strong peripheral pulse and warm extremity are required\nto perfuse the capillary beds of the extremities and allow the pulse oximeter to obtain a valid\nmeasurement, therefore it may be difficult to measure in cold or hypotensive patients.\nCAPNOGRAPHY (ETCO2) WAVEFORM  CHARACTERISTICS  CONSIDERATIONS\nCuff Leak\nWaveform\ndegrades sharply  • Check ET Tube for leak and replace\nas necessary (recommend exchange over a bougie)\nCurare Cleft\nCleft or notch in waveform  • Represents asynchronous\nventilation\n• Reassess patients level of sedation\nand augment as needed\nObstruction\nClassic shark fin\npattern  • Represents bronchospasm or\nairway obstruction\n• Assess for Hx of asthma, kinked ET\ntube, foreign body in airway or\nother anatomical airway\nobstruction.\nLoss of Waveform\nNormal waveform and then no\nwaveform  • Assess for total airway obstruction,\napnea, or cardiac arrest.\n• Assess ET tube for dislodgement and/or the need for suction\n• Check equipment for failure\nIncreasing ETCO 2\nWaveform increases in\namplitude and\nwidth  • Assess for insufficient respirations,\nif breathing spontaneously, and treat underlying cause\n• Assess for respiratory failure\n• Assess for temperature increase\n• Consider increasing minute ventilation\n• Note: TQ release and sodium bicarbonate may cause a\ntemporary increase in ETCO 2\nDecreasing ETCO 2\nWaveform decreases in\namplitude and\nwidth  • Assess for tachypnea and treat\nunderlying cause, if patient breathing spontaneously,\n• Assess for pulmonary embolism (If possible)\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  24 APPENDIX H: PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS\nPEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR MSMAID & AIRWAY MANAGEMENT\nMSMAID:\nSimilar to adult patients, the same preparatory steps should be followed prior to pediatric airway\nintervention. There are, however, significant differences with respect to equipment requirements and\nprovider skill level. The core principles of MSMAID rema in the same, with the following considerations:\n Machine – Continuous ventilation requires specific rate and volume based on the patient’s\nage/size.  Ensure your equipment (ventilator) and/or BVM can provide the required rate and\nvolume prior to intubating or performing advanced procedures .1,2\n Suction  – Similar to adults, ideally you can provide in-line suction, but you also will at a\nminimum need the correct size tubes to be able to provide suction\n Monitor  – having pediatric sized equipment is essential as  well as being able to adapt to\npediatric sizes using adult monitors\n Airway  – Multiple sizes of tubes are essential and proper pre -mission logistic planning includes\npediatric supplies\n Intravenous access  – Ensure you have pediatric sized needles with 24, 22, 20 and 18g as the\nprimary access based on age of the patient.  Pediatric intraosseous needles may be required.\n Drugs – Ensure you have a drug estimation guide, but always double check pediatric weight -\nbased doses and measurements.\nADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT\n1. Broselow Tape or similar height -based treatment aids .3\n2. Video Laryngoscopy (VL) – VL has been shown in studies to out -perform direct laryngoscopy  in\npedatric airways .4-7\n3. Pediatric Kit –  Pediatric airway equipment should be pre-packaged and set apart to allow for a\nrapid inclusion or addition to baseline airway kits .\nESSENTIAL MEASUREMENT S AND FORMULAS\nUnlike adult airways that are narrowest at the level of the vocal cords (and therefore visible during DL or VL) pediatric tracheas are narrowest at the infraglottic level  (19). In consideration of this, the following\nformulas and treatment a ids are presented to best estimate tube sizes and measurements:\n1. ETT size: age/4 +3.5 .\n8\n2. ETT insertion depth (for children over 1 year of age) in centimeters: age/2 + 13\n3. ETT insertion depth (for children under 1 year of age) in centimeters: weight/2 + 8\n4. Tidal volume: 5 -8 cc/kg , rate concordant with pre -arrest breathing or rate prior to intervention.\nPALS recommends initial rate of  at least 10 -12 breaths/minute.1,2\n5. Use caution with BVM, especially if improvising with adult BVM.  Inflate gently only until the\nchest begins to rise. Surgical Airway Management\nLMAs should be the first choice in all children prior to consideration of surgical intervention. Surgical\nairways should NOT be attempted on children younger than 12 years of age given the maturity of the\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  25 thyroid cartilage and the cricothyroid membrane. It should never be attempted in children where the\nthyroid cartilage cannot be palpated. For children needing advanced airway intervention younger than 12\nyears of age, a combination of bag -valve -mask ventilation or placement of a supraglottic airway is\nrecommended .9,1\nReferences\n1.

This applies to off- label uses\nwith patients who are armed forces members.\nBACKGROUND\nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of FDA -approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are\nusually not subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved\nuses of approved drugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances\ninclude such uses as part of clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some\ncommand requested unapproved uses may also be subject to speci al regulations.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS\nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it\ndoes not imply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to\nbe the “standard of care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the\nresponsible health care practitioner by providing information regarding potential r isks and benefits of treatment\nalternatives. The decision is for the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the\npractitioner -patient relationship.\nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES\nBalanced Discussion\nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by\nthe FDA. Further, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any\nsuch data that suggest caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA- issued warnings.\nQuality Assurance Monitoring\nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring\nof outcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this r eason, the importance of accurate clinical records is\nunderscored.\nInformation to Patients\nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an\nunusual off -label use will address the issue of informa tion to patients. When practicable, consideration will be\ngiven to including in an appendix an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product. Information to patients should address in plain language:  a) that the use is not approved\nby the FDA; b) the reasons why a DoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose;\nand c) the potential risks associated with such use."

A provider must first and foremost be an expert in TCCC , the Department of \nDefense standard of care for first responders. The intent of this PFC CPG is to provide evidence and experience -based solutions to those who manage airw ays in an austere environment. An emphasis is \nplaced on utilizing the tools and adjuncts most familiar to a Role 1 provider. The PFC capability of airway \nis addressed to reflect the reality of managing an airway in a Role 1 resource -constrained environment .  \nA separate Joint Trauma System CPG will address mechanical ventilation. This PFC CPG also introduces \nan acronym to assist providers and their teams in preparing for advanced procedures, to include airway \nmanagement.   \nBACKGROUND  \nAirway compromise is the  second leading cause of potentially survivable death on the battlefield after \nhemorrhage.1  Complete airway occlusion can cause death from suffocation within minutes. Austere \nenvironments present significant challenges with airway management. Limited provider experience and \nskill, equipment, resources, and medications shape the best management t echniques. Considerations \ninclude: limited availability of supplemental oxygen; medications for induction/rapid sequence \nintubation, paralysis, and post -intubation management ; and limitations in available equipment. Another \nreality currently is limitations  in sustainment training options, especially for advanced airway \ntechniques. Due to these challenges, some common recommendations that may be considered “rescue” \ntechniques in standard hospital airway management may be recommended earlier or in a non-stand ard \nfashion to establish and control an airway in a PFC environment.  Patients who require advanced airway \nplacement tend to undergo more interventions, be more critically injured, and ultimately have a higher proportion of deaths.  The ability to rapidly and consistently manage an airway when indicated or  spend \ntime on other resuscitative needs when airway management is not indicated, may contribute to \nimproved outcomes.\n2,3 \nINDICATIONS   FOR  AIRWAY  MANAGEMENT  \nDISRUPTED   FACE   OR  NECK   ANATOMY  \nIf managing an isolated injury  that disrupts face or neck anatomy , healthy adults may only need a \nmechanical airway placed and may not require assisted ventilation if they are not heavily sedated.  Examples of conditions requiring early airway management include:  \n Massive facial trauma   \n Burns to the face or inhalation injury with hoarseness or stridor  \n Massive neck trauma  \n Expanding neck mass/hematoma  \n Acute pharyngeal infection (Retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, epiglottitis)  \n Foreign body aspiration  \n Anaphylaxis (airway swelling)  \nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  3 INSUFFICIENT  OXYGENATION  OR  VENTILATION  \nThese indications may be apparent on initial evaluation or may emerge during the course of patient \nmanagement.  If the need to establish an airway develops more gradually, additional ele ctive airway \ntechniques can be employed.  Interventions such as prolonged manual bag or mechanical ventilation \nrequire an airway intervention to ensure best overall management.  Examples include:  \n Chest wall and pulmonary trauma (blunt or penetrating) such as flail segments, pulmonary \ncontusions (from blast, blunt or crush mechanism)  \n Burns with greater than 40% body surface area  \n Traumatic brain injury with decreased level of consciousness (GCS ≤ 8)  \n Traumatic brain injury with suspected herniation requiring hyperventilation (target ETCO 2 \nbetween 30 and 35)  \n Procedural sedation or surgical procedure \n Respiratory failure from disease, infection, or injury:  \n Chemical or toxic inhalation injuries  \n Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) from infection, massive res uscitation, drug-\ninduced or other causes  \n Primary lung infection (pneumonia)  \n Massive pulmonary embolism  \n TRALI (transfusion related acute lung injury) or TACO (transfusion associated circulatory \noverload) due to massive transfusion  \nTable 1.

In prepara tion for an advanced procedure (including \nsecuring an airway) using an acronym or other checklist approach will prove invaluable. One such \nacronym, originally developed as a simple pre -operative anesthesia checklist, is presented.   \nThe MSMAID acronym ( Mach ine, Suction, Monitor, Airway, Intravenous access, Drugs) organizes an \napproach to preparation for airway management and may also prove useful in preparation for other \nprocedures.  \nThe patient’s condition dictates the available time for a provider to consider all items on this checklist.   \nA rapidly deteriorating patient with airway disruption or compromise will need the airway procedure first and follow -on considerations later. If a patient can be more appropriately classified as semi -urgent \n(e.g.,  worsening respiratory status due to an underlying pulmonary cause) the provider will have more \ntime to consider the algorithm and prepare. Logistic considerations, and sometimes considerable time \nconstraints, will affect preparation for advanced procedures. Recommendations follow the “minimum, \nbetter, best” format.  \nMACHINE  \n(Equipment required post -intubation)  \n Minimum : Bag -Valve -Mask (BVM) with  positi ve end- expiratory pressure  (PEEP ) valve  \n Better : Automated portable ventilator (preferably with PEEP); oxygen concentrator  \n Best : Full-fe ature portable ventilator (e.g.  several ventilatory modes, PEEP); supplemental oxygen if \navailable  \nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care CPG ID: 80  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 Managing v entilators or advanced equipment unfamiliar to a provider presents challenges.  Initiate \ntelemedicine consultation for best guidance.  \nPEEP  is important for prolonged ventilation. PEEP is the pressure in the airway at the end of the \nexpiratory phase which prevents the alveoli of the lung from completely collapsing.  In a spontaneously \nbreathing person, this pressure is maintained by closing the glottis, clearing the throat, coughing, \nsighing, etc. With an invasive airway, the glottis is bypassed with the tube and “natural” PEEP is lost.  PEEP should therefore be introduced into the ventilated patient using a PEEP valve on the BVM or using the PEEP setting on a ventilator. When using BVM or ventilator, provide PEEP (recommended initial setting is 5 cm H2O).\n6 \nSUCTION  \nMinimum : Improvised suction (i.e. syring e + nasopharyngeal airway [NPA])  and patient pos itioning if\nnot contraindicated\nBetter : Manual suction bulb with adapter\nBest : Powered commercial suction with oral tip and in-line endotracheal tube suction adap ter\nSuction should be available when establishing and maintaining an airway to remove excessive secretions or blood. It is particularly important to utilize suction to facilitate view of the vocal cords during \nendotracheal intubation. In addition, suction should be available for routine patient care and \nmaintenance requirement for any intubated patients. Suction should be utilized as needed to remove secretions, mucous or blood from the airway device or oropharynx. In the event of high air way \npressures, suctio n may be used to remove mucus/mucus plugs  or to clear obstructions. In the case of \nthick secretions, a saline flush of 1 -2 mL followed by in -line suctioning of the endotracheal tube may be \nuseful.  \nNote:  During in-line suctioning of tubes, the suction should only be applied when withdrawing the \ncatheter and not upon initial insertion.  \nMONITOR  \n(Monitor ing and telemedicine support ) \nMinimum : Pulse oximeter (SpO2), assistant to monitor respirations and record manual vital signs.\nTren ding vital signs documentation. PFC flow sheet is recommended. Refer to PFC Documentation\nCPG.7  Voice or data connections to perform telemedicine communica tion\nBetter : Portable Capnometry (ETCO 2)/capnography in addition to SpO2.  Transmit photographs fro m\ns\nmartphones or personal devices to augment telemedicine communications .\nBest : Automatic vital signs monitor with SpO2, ETCO 2/waveform capnography,\n+/- elec trocardiogram (EKG);  Synchronous (real -time continuous) telemedicine using video or\nremote patient monitoring systems\nMonitoring is the active process of assessing the patient throughout a procedure. It involves the gathering, documenting and interpretation of vital signs and other data, and the continuous assessment of their clinical status. Telemedicine can be an important adjunct and critical capability to employ when monitoring a patient undergoing complex procedures.  \n\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care CPG ID: 80  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 AIRWAY  \nMinimum : Medic is prepared for a ketamine cricothyroidotomy .\nBetter : Add ability to provide continuous sedation .\nBest : Add a responsible rapid -sequence intubation capability (to include chemical paralysis) with\nairway maintenance (to include suction) and continuous sedati on.\nPer the PFC Capabilities Position Paper , a definitive airway requires control of the patient’s  airway with \nan inflated cuff in the trachea. In addition, sedation is needed to keep the patient comfortable and \nsustain the airway.8  \nA proposed algorithm was developed by Mabry RL et al  for an awake surgical airway (Figure 1) .9  This \nalgorithm incorpora tes the skills recommended for Tactical Combat Casualty Care and presents the \ndecision process deemed adequate (minimum standard) for definitive airway control in PFC.  The airway \nalgorithm is presented in its published form and surgical airway is synonymous with cricothyrotomy.  As noted above, the indications for surgical airway include disrupted face or neck anatomy, as well as a \nneed for prolonged positive pressure ventilation in a resource constrained PFC environment.  Consider \ntemporizing, if possible, with basic airway maneuvers or other airway adjuncts (e.g.; NPA, SGA).  Please see Table 1\n. \nFigure 1.

BVM  ventilation is the next step in the algorithm and though it appears to be relatively \nsimple, the procedure requires preparation, training and skill to perform correctly. A spontaneously \nbreathing pa tient may prove challenging, but properly delivered, synchronous breaths may be the only \nrequirement to assist a patient’s respirations. Care should be taken to ensure proper volume and  rate of \nbag-delivered breath. One hand should provide moderate pressur e to the bag for no more than 50% of \nthe volume of an adult bag  or just enough to see the chest begin to rise at a rate of 12-16 breaths per \nminute (one breath every 4 -5 seconds) initially. It is important to avoid hyperventilation through large or \nrapid b reaths, particularly with traumatic brain injury ( TBI) casualties, therefore ETCO 2 monitoring is \nindicated for all patients requiring assisted ventilation and all patients with altered mental status (including both TBI casualties and sedated patients). BVM  is an important airway management skill (see \nAppendix C: Bag-Valve -Mask Technique\n for a detailed description).  It is highly recommended that all \nPFC training on airway skills cover BVM skills  and techniques.  \nOP and SGA insertion can present a considerable noxious stimulus and may not be tolerated by \nconscious or even some semiconscious patients.  Additionally, the dyssynchronous use of BVM \nventilation may lead to poor patient cooperation, abno rmal tidal volumes, gastric insufflation (and \nresultant regurgitation/aspiration), or other complications.  \nThe decision to perform a cricothyroidotomy is one that is sometimes difficult.  When possible, in \nurgent but not emergency situations, a telemedici ne call should be considered to help with medical \ndecision making.  \nAn important adjunct to passing an endotracheal tube, either via the cricothyroid membrane or the oropharynx, is the use of a gum elastic bougie (sometimes also referred to as an Eschmann S tylet or, \nsimply bougie).  This device is simple, rugged and should be used to guide tube placement.  The bougie \nis placed in the trachea before the endotracheal tube and may be used first to confirm proper \npositioning by either tactile discrimination (fee ling the tube bump against the tracheal rings on \nintroduction), or by encountering a hard stop when abutted against the carina.  An endotracheal tube is \nthen introduced over the bougie into the trachea.  Lastly, the bougie is removed.  A bougie may also be \nused to change tubes in the case of a tube malfunction.  This may be accomplished by placing a bougie \nin a tube that is currently positioned, remove the tube over the bougie (ensuring the bougie remains in \nthe proper position within the airway lumen), and  replacing a new tube over that bougie.  Remove the \nbougie, leaving the new tube in place.  Confirmation procedures discussed below must be repeated once the new tube is in place.  \nConsistent with TCCC guidelines, the routine use of orotracheal intubation i s not recommended as the \nminimum standard in PFC.  This procedure requires con siderable skill and sustainment ;\n10 and requires \nappropriate sedation for both rapid sequence intubation and post -intubation management.  If a \nprovider is appropriately trained, c urrent  and practiced in the procedure, and has the required support \nequipment and medications, then orotracheal intubation may be considered.  Although preferred when \n\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care CPG ID: 80  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 possible, training in orotracheal intubation is not required to obtain a definitive airway in the PFC \noperational setting. Consider basic measures first before proceeding to either type of invasive airway.  Additional details on orotracheal intubation are included in the JTS Airway CPG\n. \n Airway management in the tactical setting requires a different conceptual approach than airway \nmanagement in the hospital, or even the civilian prehospital environment.  Differences in epidemiology, \ninjury patterns, equipment and environment must be consid ered if airway management is to be \noptimized.  First, most military casualties requiring a prehospital airway have trauma to the head, face \nor neck.  Surgical airway is often the final common pathway due to bleeding or distorted anatomy.  In \ncomparison, mo st airways in the civilian prehospital environment are placed in elderly people for \ncardiac arrest.  When reliable suction and oxygen delivery are not available, or personnel are not \nexperienced in rapid sequence intubation using neuromuscular blockade, a definitive airway will often mean a surgical airway.  \nProper   Tube  P lacement  \nMinimum : Visualization of the tube passing through the vocal cords (in the case of endotracheal\nintubation); auscultation of epigastric region (should be silent) and bilateral lung sounds (should b e\np\nresent).  Colorimetric capnography + endotracheal detection device (EDD).  Easy bilateral rise a nd\nf\nall of the chest + misting of the tube + no signs of gastric insufflation. (Reassess frequently and have\nanother medic double check if  unsure.)\nBetter : Minimum plus portable capnometer.  Ultrasound if trained/available to guide and/or verif y\npla\ncement\nBest : Continuous ETCO 2/waveform capnography\nVerification of correct tube placement must be performed every time as incorrect tube placem ent may \nbe fatal .  The REACH study5 showed that right mainstem and hypopharynx placement are the most \ncommon locations of incorrect placement of ETT.  Esophageal intubation is also common.  Subcutaneous \nplacement of cricothyroidotomy tube may occur.  Use c apnography to verify correct tube placement as \ntube misplacement can be fatal.  Auscultate, if possible, to verify bilateral breath sounds. If ultrasound is \navailable, this can be used to further verify placement in the correct position.11   \nIV/IO   ACCESS \nMinimum : If (IV) / intraosseous (IO) attempts fail or when unavailable: medication may be given\nintramuscularly or intranasally for immediate sedation to facilitate surgical cricothyroidotomy .\nCo\nntinue attempts at IV/IO access after airway has been contr olled\nBetter : 1-2 patent IV/IO\nBest : 2-3x patent i ntravenous IV/IO  with additional IO device on standby\nThough an important consideration to administer medications and fluids, do not delay an emergent airway to obtain IV/IO access in the instance you are the sole provider.  \nUltrasound may be used to help identify small or deep veins.  Ultrasound guided IV ac cess may be \nattempted if trained.  Other sites to consider for superficial IV attempts include the external jugular and saphenous veins.  If appropriately trained, consider central venous access or venous cutdown.  \n\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care CPG ID: 80  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9 DRUGS \nAirway  Placement \nMinim um: Local anesthetic for cricothyroidotomy (superficial skin anesthesia plus 1 -2 mL injected\nthrough the cricothyroid membrane); or placement without medications in unconscious patient .\n**No\nte: most sedating agents can be given IM if IV/IO has not been es tablished\nBetter : Any IV/ IO sedating agent (opioid, benzodiazepine: reference the Analgesia and Sedation\nManagement for PFC CPG  for procedural doses of such  agents) .12\nBest : Procedural dose ketamine (1 -2 mg/kg IV push) for ETT or cricothyroidotomy placement + local\nanesthetic (lidocaine) for cricothyroidotomy placement\nProlonged  Sedation \n(post-airway placement)  \nMinimum  (without IV  access ): Ketamine (sedation dose), 3-4mg/kg  IM\nBetter : IV/IO pushes of ketamine, opioid, and/or midazolam (alone or in combination as per th e\nindiv\nidual’s scope of practice, experience and availability of medications)\nBest : Ketamine IV/IO Drip. Hydromorphone or alternate opioid IV/IO push for breakthrough pain\nand midazolam IV/IO push as needed for sedatio n\n(\nReference Analgesia and Sedation Management  in PFC CPG for details and drug doses ).12 \n Be cautious with sedation, advanced airway placement and positive pressure ventilation in patients \nwho are hypotensive or under -resuscitated.  Blood pressure can fall rapidly during airway managemen t \ndue to a variety of mechanisms. \nIn all cases, monitor BP closely (every 1 -2 minutes during the procedure, every 3 -5 minutes for  \n15 minutes post-procedure).  A BP drop may be brief (if due to vagal effects of epiglottis stimulation \nduring ETT placement) or sustained (due to positive pressure ventilation, increased intrathoracic \npressure and decreased venous return to the heart). Loss of sympathetic drive secondary to pain and sedation medications, and/or continued hypovolemia can also result in hypotension. Continue resuscitation with blood products (trauma patients) or crystalloid (non -trauma patients) if a hypotensive \npatient requires immediate airway interventions. Be prepared to support blood pressure with vasopressors (e.g. epinephrine bolus or drip) if trained or under direct telemedicine guidance. \nNeuromuscular blockade (succinylcholine, rocuronium, vecuronium, etc.) is NOT recommended for use \nby the average practitioner of PFC . Though these are standard medications to use in rapid sequence \nintubatio n and ventilator management, their potential lethality in inexperienced hands does not justify \nroutine recommended use. If trained and/or under direct supervision of telemedicine support, the use of neuromuscular blockade may be considered, subject to local medical direction and protocols. \n\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  10 PERFORMANCE   IMPROVEMENT   (PI)  MONITORING  \nPOPULATION  OF  INTEREST  \n1.

Increased moisture on inspiration helps maintain \nalveolar moisture. Capnography should not be positioned in -line following HME as these moisture \ndevices can increase breathing resistance and w ork of respiration, as well as increase breathing \napparatus dead space (especially in pediatric patients). This may lead to potential worsening \nhypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. Recommended order: endotracheal tube -capnograph -HME device \n(proximal to d istal) . \nNASOGASTRIC/OROGASTRIC TUBE:  \nPlacement of a nasogastric (NG) or orogastric (OG) tube should be considered following intubation of a patient in order to decompress gastric contents, prevent aspiration and gastric distention.  \n If only supraglottic a irway access is available, consider using a supraglottic device that incorporates \nan orogastric tube port.   \n Always measure the distance from nose to stomach and note the distance prior to insertion, then verify epigastric sounds. Verify placement with sec ond practitioner if sounds are questionable or \ndifficult to auscultate.  \n Do not feed, aggressively hydrate or give oral medications through an OGT or NGT without telemedicine guidance. Always reassess tube position prior to putting anything into stomach to \nensure proper gastric placement. Feeding should not be considered until 72 hours after injury in the \nPFC environment. If volume instilled is too large or rate is too fast, there is increased risk for \nvomiting. If feeding or hydration is begun th rough an OGT or NGT, they must be accurate, \nmeasured, and monitored.  Safe airway management takes precedence over nutrition.  \n \n1.

Masks should be of the proper size and should be fitted to the \nface to obtain a seal. This is best achieved by first placing the tapered portion of the opening of the mask \nover the bridge of the nose, then covering the patient’s mouth. If using the one -person method, the \nnon-dominant had should use the “C & E” method with the thumb and index finger forming a C to cover \nthe mask, and the middle, ring and small fingers forming an E on the bone of the mandible effectively \nlifting the jaw into the mask (rather than pressing the mask onto the face).   \nThe other hand should gently squeeze the bag delivering a breath at a rate of one squeeze every 5 -6 \nseconds. There should not be a leak around the mask, and you should be able to observe the rise and \nfall of the patient’s chest. An ETCO 2 monitor may be placed in -line with the bag and mask. PEEP should \nbe used with the BVM and initially set to 5mmHg. Every  attempt should be made to maintain a seal to \nensure continued PEEP.  If the patient is breathing spontaneously, careful observation and delivery of an assisted synchronous breath should be a priority.  \n \nSome additional considerations are below:  \n1. If unable t o perform adequate single hand C & E clamp, use two handed technique with a \nsecond person to bag.  \n2. Don’t press mask down onto face when performing C & E clamp, visualize you are lifting face \ninto mask.  \n3. Be aware fingertips on “E -clamp” should be positioned on the bones of the mandible and not on \nsoft tissue, which could possibly occlude the airway.  \n4. Use “BOOTS” to predict difficult face- mask seals: Bearded, Obese, Old, Toothless, Snoring. In \naddition, maxillofacial trauma and edema from burns may prevent eff ective ventilation by BVM.  \n5. NPA should be used to assist with face mask ventilations (unless obvious contraindications such as mid -face trauma). OPA are also effective in obtunded patients or those who have received \nchemical sedation or neuromuscular blockade.  \n6. For bearded patients, lubrication of mask may assist seal. Tegaderm occlusive dressings over \nbeard may also help if available. (If Tegaderm is used in sedated patient, consider pulling off \nbefore medication wears off, to lessen pain).  \n7.

Get a second practitioner to double check and verify in sounds are questionable or cannot otherwise auscultate.  \n\u0000 Verify proper SGA placement by secondary confirmation su ch as capnography/capnometry or \ncolorimetric device.  \n\u0000 Place orogastric tube and decompress stomach if available, and compatible with SGA device (has a port specifically for OGT placement).  \nSGA Size Chart  \nEstimated patient size  LMA  King LT*  \nNeonates/Infants (up to 5kg)  1 0 \nInfants 5 -10 kg  1.5 1 \nInfants/Children 10 -20kg  2 2 \nChildren 20 -30kg  2.5 2.5 \nChildren 30 -50kg  3 3* \nAdults 50 -70kg  4 4* \nAdults 70 -100kg  5 5* \nAdults over 100kg  6  \n \n \nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  20 APPENDIX E: CRICOTHYROIDOTOMY PROCEDURE CHECKLIST  \nPREPARE PATIENT  \n1. Pre-oxygenate patient if possible.  \n2. Inspect/assemble/test equipment for cricothyroidotomy . \n3. Prepare site with alcohol and betadine -or - Chlorhexadine (Chlora -prep) . \n4. Follow MSMAID and for induction, use ketamine (1mg/kg IV/IO or 3 -4mg/kg IM) if time permits \nand the medication is available.  \nFor awake cricothyrotomy: Explain procedure to patient; *Use local anesthesia: lidocaine (1% or 2%), \nbupivacaine (0.25%, 0.5% or 1%); local through planned incision area AND approx. 1 -2mL through \ncricothyroid membrane  \nPERFORM PROCEDURE  \n1. Stabilize thyroid cartilage and keep overlying skin taught.  Maintain control with hand until the \nmembrane incision is secured (step 8 below) . \n2. Locate cricothyroid membrane (Palpate for hyoid  and tracheal rings. If unsure or difficult \nlandmarks, then measure three finger widths above sternal notch for adults) . \n3. Make vertical incision through the skin over cricothyroid membrane.  \n4. Make horizontal incision through cricothyroid membrane, then immedi ately:  \n5. Open and maintain membrane incision with tracheal hook (or curved hemostat, bougie or blunt \nend of scalpel).   \n6. Insert endotracheal/tracheostomy tube into opening and direct tube caudad into trachea until \nthe balloon is just inside the airway.  \n7. Inflat e cuff and detach syringe (palpate bulb to ensure it’s not under -inflated or over -inflated) .  \n8. Maintain control of tube at all times to prevent dislodgement . \n9. Attach waveform capnography, or capnometry, or colorimetric device to confirm proper placement of t ube.  \n10. Being careful not to dislodge the tube, attach BVM with PEEP and further check placement \n(epigastric and bilateral chest) and adequacy of bilateral insufflation of lungs.  \n11. Remove BVM (if sufficient respiratory effort), assess respirations for adequacy  (rate, rhythm, \nand quality), assist ventilations if needed.  \n12. Secure with sutures and tie with girth hitch passed around the neck if time permits. As a stopgap, may use chest seal or secure around the neck with tie, ensuring inflation bulb does not \nget caught.  \n13. Consider placing NG/OG tube if available.  \n \nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  21 APPENDIX F: POST CRICOTHYROTOMY/ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION CHECKLIST  \nPOST CRICOTHYROTOMY/ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION CHECKLIST  \n\u0000 Double check placement with waveform capnography or capnometry, placed directly on ET tube \nadapter.  \n\u0000 Check proper tube depth (not main ste m) by auscultating bilateral lung sounds  \n\u0000 Check that tube is secured (suture to skin + tie with girth hitch around neck, should be able to fit 2 fingers under the tube tie)  \n\u0000 Bag-valve -mask (BVM ) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP ) valve @ 5 of PEEP at proper \nvolume (one hand moderate squeeze) and proper rate (one squeeze every 5 -6 seconds)  \n\u0000 Provide adequate analgesia and sedation (follow analgesia and sedation CPG)  \n\u0000 Calculate remaining medication and establish analgesia and sedation plan.  A patient w ith a \ncricothyroidotomy may not require heavy continuous sedation.  \n\u0000 Raise the head and torso to 30 - 45° \n\u0000 Filter and humidify the air with a heat moisture exchanger.

Inexpensive \ncolorimetric CO 2 detectors are available, however the color change method may be very difficult to \nvisualize with poor lighting or night vision devices.  Waveform capnography measures the end -tidal \ncarbon dioxide that passes through the device as the patient exhales in real time since it is placed directly in- line with the endotracheal tube. ETCO\n2 may also be attached to a face mask to verif y normal \nand spontaneous breaths if  an advanced airway has not been placed. With most portable, field \ncapnographs, a number in mmHg will be appear on the display, which indicates the value of the CO 2 in \nthe exhaled breath and can be an immediate confirmati on of correct tube placement. If the airway was \nplaced correctly, and the patient is ventilating normally, the capnograph should read between  \n35-45 mmHg. Some other examples include:  \n ETCO 2 = 0: the tube is not transmitting any CO 2: disconnected, tube plac ed in wrong position or has \nbecome dislodged.  This may also occur if the patient is dead and there is no gas exchange.  \n ETCO 2 <35: Hyperventilation. The most common cause is over -bagging the patient, but may also \nindicate pain or anxiety. The only indicati on for “induced” hyperventilation is severe traumatic brain \ninjury with signs of acute herniation, GOAL = 30 -35 (no less than 30)  \n ETCO 2 >45: Retaining CO 2, ineffective ventilation may indicate oversedation, primary lung problem, \nbrain injury, worsening obs tructive disease (asthma).  If the trend is rising, this is an indicator of \nneed for active ventilation assistance (BVM or mechanical ventilator)  \nDuring CPR (as an indicator of effectiveness of chest compressions and return of circulation):  \n ETCO 2 < 10: there is no return of CO 2 to the lungs (no effective circulation).  If CPR is initiated, it is \nineffective  \n ETCO 2 = 10 -20: EFFECTIVE CPR  \n ETCO 2 = 40 OR GREATER: You may see an abnormally high CO 2 reading immediately after return of \nspontaneous circulation (ROSC), for instance after a successful defibrillation or return of effective cardiac activity.  \nMonitor that can provide waveform capnography can provide much more insight into a patient’s \nventilation and oxygenation status. A quick reference to the most common waveforms is helpful to \nunderstanding the status of a patient.  \nPulse oximetry is also of use in monitoring the oxygenation status of a patient. It can be an indirect \nmeasure of oxygen deliv ery to the tissues, and overall pulmonary function.  Pulse oximetry monitors \noxygenation by measuring absorbance differences between oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin \nthrough the use of an infrared light. Pulse oximetry, however, has some important key limitations. A \npulse oximetry reading indirectly reflects the patient’s central (pulmonary) oxygenation status by \nmeasuring the peripheral oxygenation. This means that any intervention that addresses oxygenation in \nthe lungs may not be detected by the pulse o ximeter until 30 -90 seconds after the intervention. \nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  23 Additionally, if the patient is suffering from carbon monoxide or some other forms of poisoning, the \npulse oximetry may read inaccurately. Also, a strong peripheral pulse and warm extremity are required \nto perfuse the capillary beds of the extremities and allow the pulse oximeter to obtain a valid \nmeasurement, therefore it may be difficult to measure in cold or hypotensive patients.  \nCAPNOGRAPHY (ETCO2) WAVEFORM  CHARACTERISTICS  CONSIDERATIONS  \n Cuff Leak  \nWaveform \ndegrades sharply  • Check ET Tube for leak and replace \nas necessary (recommend exchange over a bougie)  \n Curare Cleft  \nCleft or notch in waveform  • Represents asynchronous \nventilation  \n• Reassess patients level of sedation \nand augment as needed  \n Obstruction  \nClassic shark fin \npattern  • Represents bronchospasm or \nairway obstruction  \n• Assess for Hx of asthma, kinked ET \ntube, foreign body in airway or \nother anatomical airway \nobstruction.  \n Loss of Waveform  \nNormal waveform and then no \nwaveform  • Assess for total airway obstruction, \napnea, or cardiac arrest.  \n• Assess ET tube for dislodgement and/or the need for suction  \n• Check equipment for failure  \n Increasing ETCO 2 \nWaveform increases in \namplitude and \nwidth  • Assess for insufficient respirations, \nif breathing spontaneously, and treat underlying cause  \n• Assess for respiratory failure  \n• Assess for temperature increase \n• Consider increasing minute ventilation  \n• Note: TQ release and sodium bicarbonate may cause a \ntemporary increase in ETCO 2 \n Decreasing ETCO 2 \nWaveform decreases in \namplitude and \nwidth  • Assess for tachypnea and treat \nunderlying cause, if patient breathing spontaneously,  \n• Assess for pulmonary embolism (If possible)  \n \n\nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  24 APPENDIX H: PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS  \nPEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR MSMAID & AIRWAY MANAGEMENT  \nMSMAID:  \nSimilar to adult patients, the same preparatory steps should be followed prior to pediatric airway \nintervention. There are, however, significant differences with respect to equipment requirements and \nprovider skill level. The core principles of MSMAID rema in the same, with the following considerations:  \n Machine – Continuous ventilation requires specific rate and volume based on the patient’s \nage/size.  Ensure your equipment (ventilator) and/or BVM can provide the required rate and \nvolume prior to intubating or performing advanced procedures .1,2 \n Suction  – Similar to adults, ideally you can provide in-line suction, but you also will at a \nminimum need the correct size tubes to be able to provide suction \n Monitor  – having pediatric sized equipment is essential as  well as being able to adapt to \npediatric sizes using adult monitors  \n Airway  – Multiple sizes of tubes are essential and proper pre -mission logistic planning includes \npediatric supplies  \n Intravenous access  – Ensure you have pediatric sized needles with 24, 22, 20 and 18g as the \nprimary access based on age of the patient.  Pediatric intraosseous needles may be required. \n Drugs – Ensure you have a drug estimation guide, but always double check pediatric weight -\nbased doses and measurements.  \nADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT  \n1. Broselow Tape or similar height -based treatment aids .3 \n2. Video Laryngoscopy (VL) – VL has been shown in studies to out -perform direct laryngoscopy  in \npedatric airways .4-7 \n3. Pediatric Kit –  Pediatric airway equipment should be pre-packaged and set apart to allow for a \nrapid inclusion or addition to baseline airway kits . \nESSENTIAL MEASUREMENT S AND FORMULAS \nUnlike adult airways that are narrowest at the level of the vocal cords (and therefore visible during DL or VL) pediatric tracheas are narrowest at the infraglottic level  (19). In consideration of this, the following \nformulas and treatment a ids are presented to best estimate tube sizes and measurements:  \n1. ETT size: age/4 +3.5 . \n8 \n2. ETT insertion depth (for children over 1 year of age) in centimeters: age/2 + 13  \n3. ETT insertion depth (for children under 1 year of age) in centimeters: weight/2 + 8  \n4. Tidal volume: 5 -8 cc/kg , rate concordant with pre -arrest breathing or rate prior to intervention. \nPALS recommends initial rate of  at least 10 -12 breaths/minute.1,2 \n5. Use caution with BVM, especially if improvising with adult BVM.  Inflate gently only until the \nchest begins to rise. Surgical Airway Management  \nLMAs should be the first choice in all children prior to consideration of surgical intervention. Surgical \nairways should NOT be attempted on children younger than 12 years of age given the maturity of the \nAirway Management in Prolonged Field Care  CPG ID: 80  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  25 thyroid cartilage and the cricothyroid membrane. It should never be attempted in children where the \nthyroid cartilage cannot be palpated. For children needing advanced airway intervention younger than 12 \nyears of age, a combination of bag -valve -mask ventilation or placement of a supraglottic airway is \nrecommended .9,1 \nReferences  \n1.

This applies to off- label uses \nwith patients who are armed forces members.   \nBACKGROUND  \nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of FDA -approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are \nusually not subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved \nuses of approved drugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances \ninclude such uses as part of clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some \ncommand requested unapproved uses may also be subject to speci al regulations.   \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS \nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it \ndoes not imply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to \nbe the “standard of care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the \nresponsible health care practitioner by providing information regarding potential r isks and benefits of treatment \nalternatives. The decision is for the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the \npractitioner -patient relationship.  \nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES  \nBalanced Discussion  \nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by \nthe FDA. Further, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any \nsuch data that suggest caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA- issued warnings.  \nQuality Assurance Monitoring  \nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring \nof outcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this r eason, the importance of accurate clinical records is \nunderscored.  \nInformation to Patients  \nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an \nunusual off -label use will address the issue of informa tion to patients. When practicable, consideration will be \ngiven to including in an appendix an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product. Information to patients should address in plain language:  a) that the use is not approved \nby the FDA; b) the reasons why a DoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose; \nand c) the potential risks associated with such use.  \n",

Patients are moved only as far rearward as the tactical situation dictates and as clinical\nneeds warrant. Prompt movement of patients to the required level of clinical care is essential to prevent morbidity and\nmortality. Each Service component has medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) or casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) capability to do so.\nPatient movement consists of three components:\n medical regulating\n patient evacuation\n en route care (ERC)\nEn Route Care (ERC ) is deﬁned in Joint Publication (JP) 1- 02, Department of Defense  (DoD)  Dictionary of Military and\nAssociated Terms and JP 4- 02 as the continuation of the provision of care during movement (evacuation) between the\nhealth service support capabilities in the roles of care, without clinically compromising the patient’s condition. ERC involves\nthe provision of transitory medical care, patient holding, and staging capabilities during transport from the point of injury or\nonset of disease throu ghout the continuum of care.\nTo ensure the safe transport of casualties during evacuation to deﬁnitive care, patients must be adequately prepared for\nevacuation. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Guideline  (CPG)  is to provide a ready resource for those who are\nresponsible for preparing a patient for en route care.\nPATIENT  PREPARATION\nThe goal of ERC casualty preparation is to provide the continued level of medical support as the casualty is transported\nthroughout the battlespace and diﬀering roles of care. Considerations for planning during transport can be categorized into\ngroups of concerns: 1) safety, 2) access, and 3) organization. When planning for any casualty transfer , the transport team\nshould prepare for 2- 3 times longer transport time than initially projected (i .e. If the transport is anticipated to take\n2 hours, plan for 4-6 hours).\nTransport safety includes the safety of both the casualty and the ERC team’s interaction with the casualty. All casualties\nshould be provided thermal regulation, visual protection, and auditory protection from the transport environment.  Casualty\npreparation for transport can be divided into two  phases: ground preparation and transport team preparation.\nGROUND   PREPARATION\n1. Prepare the patient for the transport team to arrive.\n2. Sending facility develops the 9- Line casualty request and M.I.S.T. ( Mechanism of injury, I njuries sustained,\nSigns/symptoms, Treatment given) report\n3. Gather the casualty’s medications, personal eﬀects, identiﬁcation, travel orders, and documentation.\n4. Complete any time or resource intensive interventions prior to ERC team arrival to optimize transport requirements\nand minimize delays.\nTRANSPORT  (ERC)   TEAM  PREPARATION\nConsists of planning and execution phases.\nPlanning  Phase\nThis phase begins upon receipt of the 9- line medical evacuation request and M.I.S.T.  report. Each aspect of the 9- Line\nrequest is important for the transport team, but emphasis is placed on the number and criticality of casualties, as well as\nEn Route Care (ERC) Patient Packaging CPG ID: 97\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  4 the tactical situation. Accuracy is key - as the incoming ERC team must ensure that the casualty load will not overwhelm\ntheir resources or capabilities. The ERC team’s clear understanding will lead to their arrival with the correct resources and\nthe patient disposition to the appropriate medical  facility.\nExecution  Phase\nDuring this phase, time is of the essence. Upon arrival at the initiating facility, the ERC team should contact the provider\nrequesting the evacuation. The goal is to decrease the amount of time spent preparing the patient and rapidly move to\ntransport. Th e ERC team will assign tasks to ensure that each member is appropriately utilized. Tasks that should be\ncompleted by the team include  receiving report, assessing the patient, validating the movement of the casualty, verifying\ncorrect packaging in preparation for departure, packaging the patient for transport, and development of the en route plan.\n1. Report   and   Patient Assessment\nThe ERC team will guide the report and assessment process. The use of the MARCH acronym (Appendix B ) can assist both\nthe sending and transport teams in communicating the appropriate information in the least amount of time. Often the\npriorities of the sending team diﬀer from those of the ERC team. The ERC team should receive report, ask questions\npertinen t to the status and transfer of the patient, and then provide an opportunity for the sending team to provide\nadditional information.  If hand oﬀ must occur in high ambient noise environments such as engines running on/oﬀ -load or\nhelicopter hot -load sending , provider should point to each wound(especially areas of controlled or suspected hemorrhage)\nwith conﬁrmation of receiving team of wounds/injuries. Use of a communication device  (such as the Atlantic Signal Tactical\nMedic Intercom) that allows sending and receiving team aircraft -side verbal communication is hugely beneﬁcial and\nunits/teams should coordinate this beforehand.\nOnce the report has been completed, an assessment will be performed to conﬁrm ﬁndings and interventions. This assessment will develop the “Do Now” status of the casualty. The “Do Now” criteria are the current MARCH ﬁndings from\nthe report and the assessment that need immediate intervention to prepare for transport.  As each of the “Do Now”\ncriteria are identiﬁed, secondary logistic supply needs and assessment needs are developed.\n2. Validate  the Movement of the Casualty\nThe ﬁndings of the ERC casualty assessment assist in the validation of the decision to transport the casualty. The JTS CPG on\nthe Interfacility Transport of Casualties Between Theater MTFs  gi ves clear guidance on the resuscitation goals that should be\nfollowed to identify when a casualty is safe to transfer.  If one  or more of these goals is not met, a plan must be developed\nto optimize the casualty in accordance with resources and tactical situations.\n3. Verify  Correct  Packaging in Preparation  for  Departure\nOnce the casualty is validated for movement, supply needs can be ﬁled under the “Take With” portion of casualty\ntransport planning. The goal of this portion of the planning process is to ask the “what if“ question  for each of the\ncasualty’s interventions. This item list will include back -up support devices and batteries, dressing reinforcement supplies,\nnext step interventions, medications for continued treatment, and documentation.\n4. Packaging the  Patient  for Transport\nPackage the casualty to ensure safety of the casualty and team, access to all relevant interventions, and organization of resources. Monitors should be placed on the litter structure or attached to a litter device to ensure that NO EQUIPMENT IS\nRESTING ON THE CASUALTY , it is fully secure to the litter system, and that all team members have access to and can view\nthe monitors. Securing devices, such as litter straps used for equipment, should not be used for the casualty. All casualties\nshould be secured with a minimum of two  strap style devices. It is also recommended that any tubing or wires be secured\nwith litter straps to prevent snaring or disconnection during movement.\nEn Route Care (ERC) Patient Packaging CPG ID: 97\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 5. Development of the  “En  Route” Plan\nDevelop the assessment protocol for your casualty while in transport. This is an opportunity for the team to clearly\nsubdivide tasks and ensure that all aspects of casualty care will be met. It is key to remember that vital signs should be checked regularl y. This will create a pattern repetition or “battle rhythm” for the transport period.\nDocumentation and report are developed from the “en route” portion of the casualty transport plan. Depending upon the status and required eﬀort of casualty care during transport, documentation on the DD1380 or DA4700 may prove to be\ndiﬃcult to maintain.  It is imperative that, the team monitor, and document vital signs regularly as required by patient\nacuity, administer,  and document medications, and perform and document any interventions in order that they have\nbeen completed in the casualty care record.\nPEARLS  OF  PREPARATION\n1. A diﬃcult airway on the ground will NOT be easy to maintain en route. Secure the airway and ventilator support as\nneeded prior to transport.\n2. Decrease Fi O2 requirements on the ground in a controlled setting to ensure proper O2 levels and allocation of\nlimited resources en route.\n3. Predrawn/premixed medications, primed blood tubing, taping of reinforcement bandages near wound, pelvic\nbinders, and preplaced tourniquets are all examples of time saving measures to be optimized on the casualty prior\nto transport. Time is an enemy in the provider resource constrained transport environment.\n4. Early antibiotics can prevent long- term complications, ensure your casualty has antibiotic coverage or have a plan\nto initiate coverage  when appropriate .\n5. Dedicate an intravenous line for medication administration. Separate, mark, and place the administration port somewhere accessible to all team members during the transport.\n6. During assessment, ensure that the casualty is rolled, all junctional areas are investigated for injuries, and that all\nteam members auscultate lung ﬁelds, palpate chest for expansion, and assess compliance of bag valve mask\nventilation.\n7. Establish a solid baseline assessment with your team using the MARCH acronym. This will act as supporting problem solving battle rhythm for your team en route.\n8. Keep it simple! Use practical and manageable interventions to optimize your casualty en route.\n9. Use separate securing straps and devices for the casualty and any monitors. Remember casualty safety and security\nis the priority.\nEQUIPMENT\nEn route care of patients requires adequate equipment to ensure safe and successful transport. Certain information such as\nlength of ﬂight, number of patients to be transferred, and severity of patient condition should be taken into consideration\nwhen deciding the type  and number of equipment to be used. The goal of preparing equipment for patient transport is to\nensure all necessary items are accounted for, both consumable and non- consumable.\nIn general, each patient will require:\n1. Vital signs monitoring device with both invasive and non- invasive capabilities\n2. External suction machine\n3. A ventilator, depending on the patient’s respiratory status\nEn Route Care (ERC) Patient Packaging CPG ID: 97\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 Models of these pieces of equipment may vary between each service depending on availability. Additional items should be\navailable so that for each possible equipment failure or for deterioration of the patient there is a backup plan and the\nproper material s available for these plans. For example, if the external suction machine fails, a manual suction should be\navailable.\nThe length of the transport will determine the amount of medication and number of consumables that should be brought\nwith the ERC team . At minimum, twice the length of the transport should be planned for when packing items. Oxygen\nneeds and consumption rate should be calculated prior to transport to ensure enough supply is available for all legs of the transport . For example, the ﬂight time may be 15 minutes, but the ground transport time from the landing zone to the\nnext echelon of care may be an additional 20 minutes.\nConsumable equipment is that which expires or cannot be reused on\nanother patient. For all non- consumable items, fully charging\nbatteries and performing any function checks should be ensured\nbefore transport. Although some platforms have the ability to charge\nthe equipment, it is not guaranteed on every platform. These items must be properly inspected by biomedical per the maintenance\nrequirement recommended by the company of each respective piece of equipment .\nNon -consumable equipment should be secured on the patient litter or\ntransportation device so that the ERC team members can view them during transport. Equipment may be secured down by litter straps,\nratchet straps, tape, or other securement devices. Consumables may be carried by the ERC team members via bag or backpack or may be\nprestaged in the transport platform.\nGuidance on equipment, consumables, medications, and ﬂuids can be\nfound in Appendix A.\nQuantities of each have been left out as it will\nvary by transport. Although not all items on the list will need to be\nincluded for every transport, supplies needed for potential emergencies during transport should be considered.\nPATIENT  SAFETY\nMoving a patient from one echelon of care to another requires mitigation of safety risks through the use of personal\nprotective equipment (PPE). PPE is determined, in part, by the mode of transportation and terrain. PPE must be applied\nprior to transport. Land, sea, and air are possible transport environments via ruck, truck, boat,  or ship, rotary or ﬁxed wing\nplatforms. Critical thought must be used when considering the appropriate protective equipment which may include but not\nlimited to:\n1. Hearing protection (single or double)\n2. Eye protection (may or may not be ballistic grade)\n3. Cranial protection (helmet or cranial)\n4. Personal ﬂotation device or life preserver unit\n5. Hypothermia, commercial or standard warming (i.e. Hypothermia Prevention Management Kit (HPMK) ,\nwool blankets)\n6. Securing s traps to transport device.\nPatient safety considerations also must be exercised when moving the patient to, from, and within the transportation\nplatform. The patient must be properly secured to the litter or sled prior to movement. The securing devices must be\nreassessed after each movement to ensure all interventions are still in place.  Consideration must also be given to have\nadequate numbers of personnel to move the patient from one echelon to another. A f our-person litter team, directed by a ERC CONSIDERATIONS\nAt minimum, twice the length of the transport\nshould be planned for when packing items.\nOxygen needs and consumption rate should be calculated prior to transport to ensure\nenough supply is available for all legs of the transport.\nFor all non -consumable items, fully charging\nbatteries and performing any function checks should be ensured before transport.\nNon-consumable equipment should be\nsecured on the patient litter or transportation device so that the ERC team members can view them during transport\nEn Route Care (ERC) Patient Packaging CPG ID: 97\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 medic, is the safest option when moving patients on a NATO litter. After the patient is transferred to a platform for transpo rt,\nthe ﬁnal consideration is to ensure the litter or sled is secured to the conveyance. Though optimal, this ﬁnal consideratio n\nmay be omitted for the operational environment. If transporting via aircraft, work with air crew to determine the best\npatient p osition and securement method.\nPERFORMANCE  IMPROVEMENT  (PI)   MONITORING\nINTENT  (EXPECTED  OUTCOMES)\n1. Patient packaged to mitigate secondary injury (e.g., hypothermia prevention, hearing & eye protection, pressure\ninjury prevention).\n2. Completion of lifesaving interventions prior to transport.\n3.

This applies to off -label uses with patients who\nare armed forces members.\nBACKGROUND\nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of FDA- approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are usually\nnot subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved\ndrugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part\nof clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved\nuses may also be subject to special regulations.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS\nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it does not\nimply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard\nof care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care\npractitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for t he\nclinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship.\nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES\nBalanced Discussion\nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by the FDA.\nFurther, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that\nsugge st caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA- issued warnings.\nQuality Assurance Monitoring\nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring of\noutcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.\nInformation to Patients\nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an unusual off -\nlabel use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be given to including in an\nappendix  an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product.\nInformation to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a\nDoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with\nsuch use."

Patients are moved only as far rearward as the tactical situation dictates and as clinical \nneeds warrant. Prompt movement of patients to the required level of clinical care is essential to prevent morbidity and \nmortality. Each Service component has medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) or casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) capability to do so.  \nPatient movement consists of three components:  \n medical regulating  \n patient evacuation  \n en route care (ERC)  \nEn Route Care (ERC ) is deﬁned in Joint Publication (JP) 1- 02, Department of Defense  (DoD)  Dictionary of Military and \nAssociated Terms and JP 4- 02 as the continuation of the provision of care during movement (evacuation) between the \nhealth service support capabilities in the roles of care, without clinically compromising the patient’s condition. ERC involves \nthe provision of transitory medical care, patient holding, and staging capabilities during transport from the point of injury or \nonset of disease throu ghout the continuum of care.  \nTo ensure the safe transport of casualties during evacuation to deﬁnitive care, patients must be adequately prepared for \nevacuation. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Guideline  (CPG)  is to provide a ready resource for those who are \nresponsible for preparing a patient for en route care.  \nPATIENT  PREPARATION \nThe goal of ERC casualty preparation is to provide the continued level of medical support as the casualty is transported \nthroughout the battlespace and diﬀering roles of care. Considerations for planning during transport can be categorized into \ngroups of concerns: 1) safety, 2) access, and 3) organization. When planning for any casualty transfer , the transport team \nshould prepare for 2- 3 times longer transport time than initially projected (i .e. If the transport is anticipated to take  \n2 hours, plan for 4-6 hours).  \nTransport safety includes the safety of both the casualty and the ERC team’s interaction with the casualty. All casualties \nshould be provided thermal regulation, visual protection, and auditory protection from the transport environment.  Casualty \npreparation for transport can be divided into two  phases: ground preparation and transport team preparation.   \nGROUND   PREPARATION  \n1. Prepare the patient for the transport team to arrive.   \n2. Sending facility develops the 9- Line casualty request and M.I.S.T. ( Mechanism of injury, I njuries sustained, \nSigns/symptoms, Treatment given) report  \n3. Gather the casualty’s medications, personal eﬀects, identiﬁcation, travel orders, and documentation.  \n4. Complete any time or resource intensive interventions prior to ERC team arrival to optimize transport requirements \nand minimize delays.  \nTRANSPORT  (ERC)   TEAM  PREPARATION  \nConsists of planning and execution phases.   \nPlanning  Phase  \nThis phase begins upon receipt of the 9- line medical evacuation request and M.I.S.T.  report. Each aspect of the 9- Line \nrequest is important for the transport team, but emphasis is placed on the number and criticality of casualties, as well as \nEn Route Care (ERC) Patient Packaging CPG ID: 97 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  4 the tactical situation. Accuracy is key - as the incoming ERC team must ensure that the casualty load will not overwhelm \ntheir resources or capabilities. The ERC team’s clear understanding will lead to their arrival with the correct resources and \nthe patient disposition to the appropriate medical  facility.  \nExecution  Phase  \nDuring this phase, time is of the essence. Upon arrival at the initiating facility, the ERC team should contact the provider \nrequesting the evacuation. The goal is to decrease the amount of time spent preparing the patient and rapidly move to \ntransport. Th e ERC team will assign tasks to ensure that each member is appropriately utilized. Tasks that should be \ncompleted by the team include  receiving report, assessing the patient, validating the movement of the casualty, verifying \ncorrect packaging in preparation for departure, packaging the patient for transport, and development of the en route plan.  \n1. Report   and   Patient Assessment  \nThe ERC team will guide the report and assessment process. The use of the MARCH acronym (Appendix B ) can assist both \nthe sending and transport teams in communicating the appropriate information in the least amount of time. Often the \npriorities of the sending team diﬀer from those of the ERC team. The ERC team should receive report, ask questions \npertinen t to the status and transfer of the patient, and then provide an opportunity for the sending team to provide \nadditional information.  If hand oﬀ must occur in high ambient noise environments such as engines running on/oﬀ -load or \nhelicopter hot -load sending , provider should point to each wound(especially areas of controlled or suspected hemorrhage) \nwith conﬁrmation of receiving team of wounds/injuries. Use of a communication device  (such as the Atlantic Signal Tactical \nMedic Intercom) that allows sending and receiving team aircraft -side verbal communication is hugely beneﬁcial and \nunits/teams should coordinate this beforehand.  \nOnce the report has been completed, an assessment will be performed to conﬁrm ﬁndings and interventions. This assessment will develop the “Do Now” status of the casualty. The “Do Now” criteria are the current MARCH ﬁndings from \nthe report and the assessment that need immediate intervention to prepare for transport.  As each of the “Do Now” \ncriteria are identiﬁed, secondary logistic supply needs and assessment needs are developed.  \n2. Validate  the Movement of the Casualty  \nThe ﬁndings of the ERC casualty assessment assist in the validation of the decision to transport the casualty. The JTS CPG on \nthe Interfacility Transport of Casualties Between Theater MTFs  gi ves clear guidance on the resuscitation goals that should be \nfollowed to identify when a casualty is safe to transfer.  If one  or more of these goals is not met, a plan must be developed \nto optimize the casualty in accordance with resources and tactical situations.  \n3. Verify  Correct  Packaging in Preparation  for  Departure  \nOnce the casualty is validated for movement, supply needs can be ﬁled under the “Take With” portion of casualty \ntransport planning. The goal of this portion of the planning process is to ask the “what if“ question  for each of the \ncasualty’s interventions. This item list will include back -up support devices and batteries, dressing reinforcement supplies, \nnext step interventions, medications for continued treatment, and documentation.  \n4. Packaging the  Patient  for Transport  \nPackage the casualty to ensure safety of the casualty and team, access to all relevant interventions, and organization of resources. Monitors should be placed on the litter structure or attached to a litter device to ensure that NO EQUIPMENT IS \nRESTING ON THE CASUALTY , it is fully secure to the litter system, and that all team members have access to and can view \nthe monitors. Securing devices, such as litter straps used for equipment, should not be used for the casualty. All casualties  \nshould be secured with a minimum of two  strap style devices. It is also recommended that any tubing or wires be secured \nwith litter straps to prevent snaring or disconnection during movement.  \n \n \nEn Route Care (ERC) Patient Packaging CPG ID: 97 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 5. Development of the  “En  Route” Plan  \nDevelop the assessment protocol for your casualty while in transport. This is an opportunity for the team to clearly \nsubdivide tasks and ensure that all aspects of casualty care will be met. It is key to remember that vital signs should be checked regularl y. This will create a pattern repetition or “battle rhythm” for the transport period.   \nDocumentation and report are developed from the “en route” portion of the casualty transport plan. Depending upon the status and required eﬀort of casualty care during transport, documentation on the DD1380 or DA4700 may prove to be \ndiﬃcult to maintain.  It is imperative that, the team monitor, and document vital signs regularly as required by patient \nacuity, administer,  and document medications, and perform and document any interventions in order that they have \nbeen completed in the casualty care record.   \nPEARLS  OF  PREPARATION  \n1. A diﬃcult airway on the ground will NOT be easy to maintain en route. Secure the airway and ventilator support as \nneeded prior to transport.  \n2. Decrease Fi O2 requirements on the ground in a controlled setting to ensure proper O2 levels and allocation of \nlimited resources en route.  \n3. Predrawn/premixed medications, primed blood tubing, taping of reinforcement bandages near wound, pelvic \nbinders, and preplaced tourniquets are all examples of time saving measures to be optimized on the casualty prior \nto transport. Time is an enemy in the provider resource constrained transport environment.  \n4. Early antibiotics can prevent long- term complications, ensure your casualty has antibiotic coverage or have a plan \nto initiate coverage  when appropriate . \n5. Dedicate an intravenous line for medication administration. Separate, mark, and place the administration port somewhere accessible to all team members during the transport.  \n6. During assessment, ensure that the casualty is rolled, all junctional areas are investigated for injuries, and that all \nteam members auscultate lung ﬁelds, palpate chest for expansion, and assess compliance of bag valve mask \nventilation.  \n7. Establish a solid baseline assessment with your team using the MARCH acronym. This will act as supporting problem solving battle rhythm for your team en route.  \n8. Keep it simple! Use practical and manageable interventions to optimize your casualty en route.  \n9. Use separate securing straps and devices for the casualty and any monitors. Remember casualty safety and security \nis the priority.  \nEQUIPMENT  \nEn route care of patients requires adequate equipment to ensure safe and successful transport. Certain information such as \nlength of ﬂight, number of patients to be transferred, and severity of patient condition should be taken into consideration \nwhen deciding the type  and number of equipment to be used. The goal of preparing equipment for patient transport is to \nensure all necessary items are accounted for, both consumable and non- consumable.  \nIn general, each patient will require:  \n1. Vital signs monitoring device with both invasive and non- invasive capabilities \n2. External suction machine  \n3. A ventilator, depending on the patient’s respiratory status  \nEn Route Care (ERC) Patient Packaging CPG ID: 97 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 Models of these pieces of equipment may vary between each service depending on availability. Additional items should be \navailable so that for each possible equipment failure or for deterioration of the patient there is a backup plan and the \nproper material s available for these plans. For example, if the external suction machine fails, a manual suction should be \navailable.  \nThe length of the transport will determine the amount of medication and number of consumables that should be brought \nwith the ERC team . At minimum, twice the length of the transport should be planned for when packing items. Oxygen \nneeds and consumption rate should be calculated prior to transport to ensure enough supply is available for all legs of the transport . For example, the ﬂight time may be 15 minutes, but the ground transport time from the landing zone to the \nnext echelon of care may be an additional 20 minutes.  \nConsumable equipment is that which expires or cannot be reused on \nanother patient. For all non- consumable items, fully charging \nbatteries and performing any function checks should be ensured \nbefore transport. Although some platforms have the ability to charge \nthe equipment, it is not guaranteed on every platform. These items must be properly inspected by biomedical per the maintenance \nrequirement recommended by the company of each respective piece of equipment .  \nNon -consumable equipment should be secured on the patient litter or \ntransportation device so that the ERC team members can view them during transport. Equipment may be secured down by litter straps, \nratchet straps, tape, or other securement devices. Consumables may be carried by the ERC team members via bag or backpack or may be \nprestaged in the transport platform.  \nGuidance on equipment, consumables, medications, and ﬂuids can be \nfound in Appendix A.\n Quantities of each have been left out as it will \nvary by transport. Although not all items on the list will need to be \nincluded for every transport, supplies needed for potential emergencies during transport should be considered.    \nPATIENT  SAFETY  \nMoving a patient from one echelon of care to another requires mitigation of safety risks through the use of personal \nprotective equipment (PPE). PPE is determined, in part, by the mode of transportation and terrain. PPE must be applied \nprior to transport. Land, sea, and air are possible transport environments via ruck, truck, boat,  or ship, rotary or ﬁxed wing \nplatforms. Critical thought must be used when considering the appropriate protective equipment which may include but not \nlimited to:   \n1. Hearing protection (single or double)  \n2. Eye protection (may or may not be ballistic grade)  \n3. Cranial protection (helmet or cranial)  \n4. Personal ﬂotation device or life preserver unit  \n5. Hypothermia, commercial or standard warming (i.e. Hypothermia Prevention Management Kit (HPMK) ,  \nwool blankets)  \n6. Securing s traps to transport device. \nPatient safety considerations also must be exercised when moving the patient to, from, and within the transportation \nplatform. The patient must be properly secured to the litter or sled prior to movement. The securing devices must be \nreassessed after each movement to ensure all interventions are still in place.  Consideration must also be given to have \nadequate numbers of personnel to move the patient from one echelon to another. A f our-person litter team, directed by a ERC CONSIDERATIONS  \nAt minimum, twice the length of the transport \nshould be planned for when packing items.  \nOxygen needs and consumption rate should be calculated prior to transport to ensure \nenough supply is available for all legs of the transport.  \nFor all non -consumable items, fully charging \nbatteries and performing any function checks should be ensured before transport.  \nNon-consumable equipment should be \nsecured on the patient litter or transportation device so that the ERC team members can view them during transport  \nEn Route Care (ERC) Patient Packaging CPG ID: 97 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 medic, is the safest option when moving patients on a NATO litter. After the patient is transferred to a platform for transpo rt, \nthe ﬁnal consideration is to ensure the litter or sled is secured to the conveyance. Though optimal, this ﬁnal consideratio n \nmay be omitted for the operational environment. If transporting via aircraft, work with air crew to determine the best \npatient p osition and securement method.  \nPERFORMANCE  IMPROVEMENT  (PI)   MONITORING \nINTENT  (EXPECTED  OUTCOMES)  \n1.

This applies to off -label uses with patients who \nare armed forces members.   \nBACKGROUND  \nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of FDA- approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are usually \nnot subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved \ndrugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part \nof clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved \nuses may also be subject to special regulations.   \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS \nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it does not \nimply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard \nof care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care \npractitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for t he \nclinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship. \nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES  \nBalanced Discussion  \nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by the FDA. \nFurther, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that \nsugge st caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA- issued warnings.  \nQuality Assurance Monitoring  \nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring of \noutcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.  \nInformation to Patients  \nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an unusual off -\nlabel use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be given to including in an  \nappendix  an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product. \nInformation to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a \nDoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with \nsuch use.  \n \n",

Mechanical ventilation can injure the lung. Appropriate ventilator strategies help minimize\nventilator induced lung injury.\nb. Lung protective ventilation is appropriate for most CCAT patients, even if they do not have Acute\nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).\ni. While many patients transported by CCATT who are mechanically ventilated may not meet diagnostic for ARDS, similar pathophysiologic processes such as alveolar overdistention (volutrauma), barotrauma, atelectrauma, and inflammation are likely at work.\nii. In patients at risk for ARDS, a lung protective ventilation strategy reduces the risk of developing ARDS\nc. This document closely follows the ventilation strategy from the ARDS Network ARMA trial.\ni. This is the least harmful strategy formally studied and validated in a large trial.\nii. Some experts may choose to deviate from the strategy in an individual patient.\niii. The strategy has been modified in some respects to simplify its use.\nDETERMINING STABILITY FOR FLIGHT\na. Stability for flight is a multi -factorial decision based on the patient, sending facility, CCAT team, and\nflight characteristics.\nb. Patient characteristics\ni. PEEP and FIO2\n1. PEEP / FiO2 greater than 14 cm H2O / 70% should prompt careful consideration of risks and benefits. Such patients have little room to increase FiO2 or mean airway pressure if\ntheir condition worsens during flight. However, it is still possible to transport  these\npatients safely.\n2. All patients, including those on mechanical ventilation, will experience a decrease in PO2 as the partial pressure of oxygen in the air decreases as you increase in altitude.\na. Patients with marginal gas exchange will require additional support during flight.\nb. A cabin altitude restriction will lessen the impact on oxygenation.\nii. Patients on aggressive support that has been stable over time are better candidates for\ntransport than those with increasing support leading up to flight time.\niii. Concurrent hemodynamic compromise, severe metabolic acidosis, or traumatic brain injury\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48\nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical Judgement   3 will complicate ventilator management and should be considered in assessing stability for\nflight.\nc. Sending facility characteristics\ni. Type of ventilators available\nii. Availability of rescue therapies (proning, inhaled nitric oxide/prostacyclin, advanced\nmechanical ventilation techniques, etc.)\niii. Personnel experience and expertise\niv. Current beds available and anticipated casualties\nd. Expertise of CCAT team members with advanced mechanical ventilation strategies\ne. Flight characteristics\ni. Flight duration\nii. Aircraft type\niii. Patient load and complexity\niv. Altitude restriction\nf. If in doubt about the patient’s respiratory stability for transport consult the ECMO team\ni. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is available 24/7 by calling commercial 210 -\n916-ECMO (3266). The Brooke Army Medical Center ECMO team is a joint endeavor with the\n59th Medical Wing and the US Army Institute for Surgical Research.\nii. ECMO team’s transport capabilities include ECMO for cardiopulmonary support and continuous renal replacement therapy. Early consultation is encouraged to facilitate planning.\niii. ECMO team can provide expert management guidance even if they do not transport the patient.\nPRE -FLIGHT PREPAR ATION\na. Ventilator\ni. Most patients can be safely transported using the Impact 731 ventilator.\n1. Allows for volume control or pressure control ventilation.\n2. Altitude compensated.\n3. Rated for patients 5 kg and above.\na. For patients 5 -30 Kg a 731 infant/pediatric circuit with 4.2ml of dead space should be\nutilized\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48\nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   4 b. Patients less than 5 Kg are usually transported by a Neonatal Transport Team.\n4. Inverse ratio limited to I:E of 2:1\nb. Oxygen\ni. Oxygen requirements should be calculated for all patients.\n1. Refer to Appendix A.   ****Appendix A refers to the LTV 1000 ventilator and may no\nlonger be applicable****\na. There is no safety factor in the calculations.\nb. Additional oxygen beyond calculated requirement should be determined by each\nteam on a case -by-case basis based on patient and transport characteristics.\nii. Each mechanically ventilated patient should ideally have a dedicated PTLOX.\niii. Aeromedical Evacuation AFIs support 2 patients on high -flow and recommend that 3rd\npatient should be on low -flow.\niv. The Aeromedical Evacuation team is responsible for allocating oxygen and will make that\ndetermination. CCATT, AE, and front -end Aircrew must work together to balance medical,\nlogistic, and tactical challenges.\nc. Patient Preparation\ni. Patients with respiratory disease should be placed on the transport ventilator as soon as feasible by CCATT to ensure that the patient can be safely maintained on transport ventilator\nand allow time for an ABG to be drawn.\nii. Medical Teams that are preparing patients with respiratory dysfunction for transport within\nthe next 24hrs should practice conservatively in managing these patients before flight.\n1. Chest tubes should be left in place, particularly for patients on positive pressure\nventilation. As patients climb in altitude, any residual pneumothorax may re- expand.\nAdditionally, patients may require increasing ventilatory pressures to achieve\noxygenat ion goals at altitude, putting the patient at risk for recurrent/worsening\npneumothorax.\n2. Patients on a ventilator typically should not be extubated immediately prior to transport. The decreased partial pressure of oxygen at altitude may not be easily\novercome with non -invasive oxygenation.  Additionally, transport can be painful and\nmay requir e higher doses of pain medication.  Both factors put a recently extubated\npatient at risk for respiratory insufficiency and reintubation.\niii. Review CXR\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48\nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   5 1. Note ETT depth and ensure correlation with CXR\n2. Note invasive line positioning\n3. Consider repeating CXR if more than 12 hrs. old or if clinical conditions have changed.\niv. Secure ET tube using a dedicated securing device.\n1. If burns or facial trauma preclude this, consider securing tube to upper lateral incisor\nand adjoining canine tooth using silk suture or wire. Umbilical tape is also acceptable.\n2. Be certain that lips and tongue are not injured by device.\nv. Avoid exposing airway to atmospheric pressure during ventilator changeover if PEEP is ≥ 10cm\nH2O.\n1. Lung de-recruitment occurs rapidly with exposure to atmospheric pressure.\n2. Gently clamp ET tube using a Kelly clamp while the circuit is broken for ventilator\nchangeover.\n3. Pad the Kelly clamp with tape or short pieces of rubber tubing to avoid damage to the\nET tube.\n4. Do not clamp wire reinforced tubes as they will kink permanently.\nvi. All ventilated patients should have a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) in place.\nvii. Check ET tube cuff pressure prior to departure.\n1. Proper ET tube cuff inflation is mandatory to avoid aspiration, de-recruitment and\nventilator malfunction (pressure too low) or damage to tracheal mucosa (pressure too\nhigh).\n2. Palpating ET tube cuff is inaccurate and should not be relied upon to estimate cuff pressure. Use a cuff manometer .\n3. Goal Cuff Pressure is typically 20 –  30 cm H 2O (15-22 mm Hg). Alternatively, the Minimal\nLeak Test should be used in pediatric patients and can be used safely in adults.\n4. ET tube cuffs should be filled with air. Do not use saline.\nviii. All ventilated patients should have the head of bed elevated at least 30° unless there is a contraindication.\n1. Most patients will not have a contraindication. Ask the sending physician or\nneurosurgeon for clarification if necessary.\n2. The backrest designed for the NATO litter is the most appropriate way to elevate the\nhead of bed.\nix. All ventilated patients should have continuous ETCO 2 monitoring.\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48\nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical Judgement   6 1. Use caution interpreting the absolute value of the ETCO 2 as it may not accurately reflect\nPaCO 2.\na. The difference between PaCO 2 and ETCO2 reflects dead space. A difference of 3 -5\nmmHg is normal in healthy patients. In critically ill patients this number can vary\nsignificantly and change rapidly with various disease processes.\nb. The true value is the ability to immediately detect circuit disconnections and\nventilator failures by observing changes in the waveform and to identify trends in CO2 that may prompt arterial blood gas measurement.\n2. Should CPR be necessary, ETCO 2 monitoring may be used to evaluate the adequacy of\nchest compressions, the goal is greater than 10 mmHg at a minimum and 20 mmHg ideally.\n3. Additionally, ETCO2 waveforms may offer insight into a variety of respiratory dynamics.\nx. All ventilated patients require gastric decompression at take-off and landing.\n1. Large bore oro -gastric tubes are preferred to large bore naso -gastric tubes for\ndecompression to reduce the risk of sinusitis.\n2. For babies and others at risk of hypoglycemia, weigh the risks and benefits of discontinuing enteral feeds. If gastric feeds must be terminated, monitor patient for hypoglycemia and/or have a plan to mitigate this with dextrose containing fluids.\n3. Patients with post pyloric feeding tubes and secured airways (ETT or Trach with cuff inflated) have a very low risk of aspiration and may continue enteral feeding.\nBASIC VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT\na. Mode of Ventilation\ni. Avoiding injurious ventilator settings is far more important than the mode of ventilation.\nii. There is no outcome-based evidence favoring one mode of ventilation over another.\niii. Patients in the landmark ARDSNet ARMA trial were all ventilated in volume assist -control\nventilation and many clinicians choose to use this mode primarily.\n1. However, pressure control has some theoretical advantages.\na. A decelerating flow waveform is more comfortable for the patient and may improve gas mixing. This is only available in PC mode on the 731 ventilator. VC mode on the\n731 ventilator only allows square wave flow, unlike most ICU ventilators.\nb. Inverting I:E ratio is an option for increasing the mean airway pressure (and thus\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48\nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   7 improving oxygenation). This is easier to manage in PC than VC.\nc. Setting a Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) ensures that the Plateau Pressure (Pplat)\nwill remain below PIP.\n2. A theoretical drawback to Pressure Control is that close attention must be paid to tidal\nvolumes delivered as they can change over time due to changes in the patient’s\nphysiology.\nb. Ventilator Settings\ni. Initial approach and assessment\n1. For patients on a ventilator, start by trying to match prior vent settings\n2. Place patients with respiratory dysfunction on the transport vent early to verify stability\n3. The presence of any of the below potentially harmful vent settings or patient\ncharacteristics should prompt consultation with the ECMO transport team.  Consider\nconsultation even if ECMO transport is not possible as they can offer additional\nmanagement suggestions.\na. Pplat > 32\nb. PIP > 40\nc. FiO2 > 60% on appropriate PEEP\nd. PEEP > 14\ne. pH < 7.25 despite attempts to increase MV\nf. P/F Ratio < 150 despite on appropriate PEEP and FiO2\n4. Patients will likely require increased PEEP or FiO2, and possibly MV at altitude. Ensure that there is room to safely titrate up all vent settings by approximately 20% at altitude.\n5. See below for guidance for newly intubated patients or patients not tolerating current\nvent settings.\nii. Tidal Volume (V T)\n1. Tidal volume should be based on predicted body weight (PBW) according to: PBW =\n50+2.3 (height in inches – 60) for males. Refer to Appendix B.  (May use “wingspan”\ninstead of height).\na. Goal V T is 4-8 cc/kg based on predicted body weight.\nb. Patients with lung injury or concern for potential lung injury should have a target V T\n6 ml/kg PBW\nc. Other patients may find a V T of 8cc/kg more comfortable than lower volumes.  This\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48\nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   8 target may be appropriate as long as PIP ≤ 40 cmH 2O and Pplat  ≤ 30 cmH 2O.\nd. If a patient is not tolerating the target V T consider additional sedation and paralytic.\ne. While V T can be manipulated to control pCO2, the best way to manage pCO2 is to\nalter the respiratory rate.  If adjusting tidal volume, do not increase V T above 8 cc/kg\nto control pCO 2\niii. Respiratory Rate\n1. Respiratory rate should be 12 -32\n2. Adjust the respiratory rate to achieve a pH between 7.35 and 7.45.  If this goal cannot\nbe reached, permissive hypercapnia is appropriate for ARDS patients without TBI.\nTolerance of pH as low as 7.25 may be appropriate for transport and allow for avoidanc e\nof injurious vent settings.  See section on “Permissive Hypercapnia” below.  If in doubt,\nconsult the ECMO team.\n3. The pH is more important that the actual pCO2  ***Not applicable to TBI patients***\n4. Patients with baseline CO2 retention will have a normal pH at elevated pCO2, this is normal.\niv. Volume Control (VC)\n1. Start at 6 -8 ml/kg PBW for patients with minimal lung disease\n2. Start at 6 ml/kg PBW for patients with respiratory dysfunction\n3. Adjust Respiratory Rate (RR) for a Minute Ventilation (MV) that achieves the goal pH and PaCO2.\n4. Check Pplat, if >30, V T can be titrated down to 4ml/kg to reach a safe Pplat.  A V T of 4\nml/kg PBW is usually uncomfortable for the patient and may require increased sedation.\n5. If PIP is elevated, consider increasing inspiratory time.  Other measures to increase airway diameter including suctioning or bronchodilators may be considered in the\nappropriate clinical circumstances.\nv. Pressure Control (VC)\n1. Switching to PC mode allows the respiratory provider to target a safe upper limit for Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and Plateau Pressure (Pplat).\na. PIP is greater than or equal to Pplat in PC mode.  If flow equals zero at the end of inspiration, PIP = Pplat, otherwise Pplat < PIP.\n2. Plateau pressures equal to or less than 30 cmH 2O are thought to be safe\n3. Driving Pressure (ΔP) = Pplat –  PEEP\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48\nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   9 a. Driving Pressures less than 15 mmHg correlate with better outcomes\nb. Driving Pressure can be titrated up or down to change V T; this is the most direct way\nto change V T.\nc. The Zoll 731 ventilator is not PEEP compensated. Increasing PEEP without changing\nthe PIP will decrease Driving Pressure and V T.\n4. Setting the PIP\na. Start by setting the vent PIP to 10 cmH 2O above PEEP (Driving pressure of 10\ncmH 2O)\nb. Quickly titrate the PIP up or down for a target V T of 4-8 ml/kg.\nc. 8 ml/kg PBW V T may be appropriate for patients without respiratory dysfunction\nd. Otherwise, for patients with any concern for lung injury, titrate PIP to achieve V T of\n6ml/kg PBW\ne. Changes of 2 -4 cmH 2O can be made every few breaths.\n5. VT can change quickly in critically ill patients leading to changes in MV/pH/PaCO2.\na. Providers must be attentive for changes in V T and MV.\nb. Decreases in Pulmonary Compliance will decrease V T\nc. Increases in Pulmonary Resistance may decrease V T\n6. Inspiratory Time can be increased or decreased to change V T\na. Increases in inspiratory time will increase V T\nb. Decreases in inspiratory time will decrease V T\nc. Changes in Respiratory Rate may change inspiratory time which may change V T\nvi. Permissive Hypercapnia –  Patients with hypercarbic respiratory failure (ex. ARDS or COPD)\nmay require permissive hypercapnia to remain in safe pressure ranges on the ventilator.\n1. Respiratory acidosis is well tolerated, to an extent. Titrating up ventilator pressures can\nbe more harmful than tolerating moderate hypercarbia.\n2. Prioritize lung protective ventilation with Pplat < 30 cmH2 O.\n3. Manipulate respiratory rate to maintain a minimum pH of 7.25.\n4. Investigate non -respiratory causes of acidosis and treat appropriately\n5. Bicarbonate administration may help in the treatment of non -anion gap acidosis.  It may\nalso be utilized as a temporizing measure for severe acidosis (pH < 7.15) with concern\nfor high risk of cardiovascular collapse.  However, note that bicarbonate will be  rapidly\nconverted to CO2 requiring increased minute ventilation for clearance, and thus may\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48\nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   10 ultimately worsen respiratory acidosis for patients unable to ventilate.\nvii. Oxygenation\n1. Oxygen saturation goals should, in general, be between 93 -99%.\na. While literature supports allowing for oxygen saturation as low as 90%, in the\ntransport environment targeting a saturation of 93% or above allows for an\nincreased degree of safety due to the number of patient handoffs and equipment\nchallenges that can be encountered.\nb. Oxygen saturation of 100% indicates a PaO2 of 100 mmHg or more and could indicate harmful hyperoxia.  Targeting normoxia of 93 -99% reduces the possibility of\nharm from hyperoxia and preserves a finite resource in flight.\n2. FiO2\na. Start at 60% for patients with minimal lung disease\nb. Start at 100% for patients with respiratory dysfunction\nc. Titrate FiO 2 in coordination with PEEP (see below)\nd. FiO2 changes can be made rapidly and are best titrated to pulse oximetry, not PaO2\non ABG.\ne. Consider increasing FiO 2 by 20% immediately prior to take off in patients with\nmarginal oxygenation\n3. PEEP\na. Start PEEP of 5 mm Hg for patients with minimal lung disease\nb. Start at a PEEP of 10-15 mm Hg for patients with hypoxic respiratory failure\nc. Attempt to match PEEP and FiO2 per ARDSNet ARMA table in Appendix B\nd. Increases in PEEP take 30 -60 min to have an effect.\ne. Decreases in PEEP take effect immediately. If PEEP is decreased too rapidly, it may take 30 -60 min to re -recruit areas of atelectasis\nf. Recruitment Maneuvers may speed response to changes increases in PEEP (see\nbelow)\ng. Consider low PEEP and High FiO2 for patients with pneumothorax, air leaks from the\nchest tube, or recent lung surgery.\nh. Recheck PIP and Pplat after titrating PEEP and ensure appropriate V T and MV\ni. High PEEP can decrease cardiac output and may cause hypotension in hypovolemic\npatients. Additional volume loading may be necessary to maintain hemodynamics.\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48\nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical Judgement   11 c. Alarms\ni. Alarms should be set to alert the team to malfunctions or changes in physiology without\ncausing frequent false alarms. The following guidance is a starting point, but each team will determine appropriate alarm settings for each mission.\nii. Suggested initial settings\n1. High pressure alarm should be set 50% above the baseline PIP (1.5 X current PIP).\n2. Low pressure alarm should be set 50% below the baseline PIP (0.5 X current PIP).\n3. High respiratory rate alarm (731 only) should be set 10 above the patient's respiratory rate.\n4. Low respiratory rate alarm (731 only) should be set 10 below the set rate.\nONGOING MANAGEMENT\na. Airway Suctioning\ni. Suctioning every 4 hours is appropriate without copious secretions or mucous plugging.\nii. Frequent suctioning may lead to lung de-recruitment and worsen gas exchange in patients\nwith ARDS.\nb. ETT Cuff Pressure\ni. Significant changes may occur on ascent and descent.  Cuff pressure increases with ascent\nand decreases with descent.\nii. Cuff pressure should be checked and documented with manometer before departure, at\ncruise altitude, during descent and after landing.\nc. Management of Oxygen Desaturation\ni. Increase FiO2 to 100% if patient is desaturating quickly while you work through evaluation.\n1. FiO2 can be quickly weaned based on SpO2 once the patient is stable\n2. Rule out equipment malfunction, loss of O2 supply, or circuit disconnect and ensure that\nthe desired FiO 2 is being delivered to the patient\nii. Confirm ET tube placement is in trachea using ETCO2 and note location at teeth/lip\niii. If desaturation is severe switch immediately to manual bag ventilation with high flow oxygen\nand PEEP valve.\n1. Suction the airway (consider simultaneous bag ventilation) to verify patency and clear mucous plugs.\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48\nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   12 2. Consider the need for ETT exchange if it is difficult to pass a suction catheter through\nthe ETT.\n3. When attempting to clear thick adherent mucous secretions make sure that the Zoll 330\nsuction machine is pulling -120 cm H 2O. It is often necessary to TEMPORARILY clamp all\nother devices attached to suction, particularly the pleurevac.\n4. Be aware that aggressive suctioning can lead to de-recruitment and mucosal injury, worsening hypoxia\niv. If the patient is dyssynchronous with the ventilator:\n1. Consider changing the ventilatory mode.\n2. Rule out pneumothorax/hemothorax.\n3. Review peak pressure trend if using volume cycled ventilation.\n4. Review V T trend if using pressure control ventilation. V T will decrease if significant\npneumothorax develops and ΔP is not changed.\n5. Evaluate existing chest tubes for proper function.\n6. Consider increasing sedation or adding paralytic.\n7. Evaluate lungs with ultrasound.\n8. Needle decompression of the chest and placement of a chest tube may be necessary if there is suspicion of pneumothorax and concurrent hemodynamic compromise.\n9. Consider needle decompression of the contralateral lung. Trauma patients are at high\nrisk of bilateral pneumothorax even if only one side of the thorax shows signs of trauma.\nv. Consider increasing PEEP. Raising PEEP may take 30 min to improve SpO2.\nvi. Consider recruitment maneuvers after increasing PEEP to next level on titration table.\n1. Additional lung can sometimes be recruited using sustained inflations (recruitment maneuvers) of the lung, particularly in patients with an increased risk of atelectasis.\n2. Current data does not support wide -spread use of recruitment maneuvers for hypoxia.\nThe risks of barotrauma outweigh the minimal benefit seen in most cases and so recruitment maneuvers are largely avoided in routine ICU care.\n3. Patients with ARDS, recent lung surgery, ongoing air -leak from pneumothorax, or under -\nresuscitation are at high risk for further injury.\n4. A typical recruitment maneuver consists of inflation to 30 -40 cm H 2O for 30-40 seconds,\nwhich is difficult to do on transport ventilators.\n5. Recruitment maneuvers increase intrathoracic pressure (by design) which can result in\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48\nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   13 decreased cardiac output and hypotension.  Monitor blood pressure closely and\nterminate any of the below recruitment maneuvers if hypotension develops.\n6. Pragmatic recruitment maneuvers on the 731 may be performed by:\na. Volume control setting:\ni. Increase peep first to match anticipated final FiO2 setting per ARDSNet\nii. Increase tidal volume to 10ml/kg for 1 minute then reduce to prior volume\nb.

Mechanical ventilation can injure the lung. Appropriate ventilator strategies help minimize \nventilator induced lung injury. \nb. Lung protective ventilation is appropriate for most CCAT patients, even if they do not have Acute \nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).  \ni. While many patients transported by CCATT who are mechanically ventilated may not meet diagnostic for ARDS, similar pathophysiologic processes such as alveolar overdistention (volutrauma), barotrauma, atelectrauma, and inflammation are likely at work.  \nii. In patients at risk for ARDS, a lung protective ventilation strategy reduces the risk of developing ARDS  \nc. This document closely follows the ventilation strategy from the ARDS Network ARMA trial. \ni. This is the least harmful strategy formally studied and validated in a large trial.  \nii. Some experts may choose to deviate from the strategy in an individual patient.  \niii. The strategy has been modified in some respects to simplify its use.  \nDETERMINING STABILITY FOR FLIGHT  \na. Stability for flight is a multi -factorial decision based on the patient, sending facility, CCAT team, and \nflight characteristics.  \nb. Patient characteristics  \ni. PEEP and FIO2  \n1. PEEP / FiO2 greater than 14 cm H2O / 70% should prompt careful consideration of risks and benefits. Such patients have little room to increase FiO2 or mean airway pressure if \ntheir condition worsens during flight. However, it is still possible to transport  these \npatients safely.  \n2. All patients, including those on mechanical ventilation, will experience a decrease in PO2 as the partial pressure of oxygen in the air decreases as you increase in altitude.  \na. Patients with marginal gas exchange will require additional support during flight.  \nb. A cabin altitude restriction will lessen the impact on oxygenation.  \nii. Patients on aggressive support that has been stable over time are better candidates for \ntransport than those with increasing support leading up to flight time.  \niii. Concurrent hemodynamic compromise, severe metabolic acidosis, or traumatic brain injury \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical Judgement   3 will complicate ventilator management and should be considered in assessing stability for \nflight.  \nc. Sending facility characteristics  \ni. Type of ventilators available  \nii. Availability of rescue therapies (proning, inhaled nitric oxide/prostacyclin, advanced \nmechanical ventilation techniques, etc.)  \niii. Personnel experience and expertise  \niv. Current beds available and anticipated casualties \nd. Expertise of CCAT team members with advanced mechanical ventilation strategies  \ne. Flight characteristics  \ni. Flight duration \nii. Aircraft type  \niii. Patient load and complexity  \niv. Altitude restriction  \nf. If in doubt about the patient’s respiratory stability for transport consult the ECMO team  \ni. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is available 24/7 by calling commercial 210 -\n916-ECMO (3266). The Brooke Army Medical Center ECMO team is a joint endeavor with the \n59th Medical Wing and the US Army Institute for Surgical Research.  \nii. ECMO team’s transport capabilities include ECMO for cardiopulmonary support and continuous renal replacement therapy. Early consultation is encouraged to facilitate planning.  \niii. ECMO team can provide expert management guidance even if they do not transport the patient.  \n \nPRE -FLIGHT PREPAR ATION  \na. Ventilator  \ni. Most patients can be safely transported using the Impact 731 ventilator.  \n1. Allows for volume control or pressure control ventilation.  \n2. Altitude compensated.  \n3. Rated for patients 5 kg and above.   \na. For patients 5 -30 Kg a 731 infant/pediatric circuit with 4.2ml of dead space should be \nutilized \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   4 b. Patients less than 5 Kg are usually transported by a Neonatal Transport Team.   \n4. Inverse ratio limited to I:E of 2:1  \nb. Oxygen  \ni. Oxygen requirements should be calculated for all patients.  \n1. Refer to Appendix A.   ****Appendix A refers to the LTV 1000 ventilator and may no \nlonger be applicable****  \na. There is no safety factor in the calculations.  \nb. Additional oxygen beyond calculated requirement should be determined by each \nteam on a case -by-case basis based on patient and transport characteristics.  \nii. Each mechanically ventilated patient should ideally have a dedicated PTLOX.  \niii. Aeromedical Evacuation AFIs support 2 patients on high -flow and recommend that 3rd \npatient should be on low -flow.  \niv. The Aeromedical Evacuation team is responsible for allocating oxygen and will make that \ndetermination. CCATT, AE, and front -end Aircrew must work together to balance medical, \nlogistic, and tactical challenges.  \nc. Patient Preparation  \ni. Patients with respiratory disease should be placed on the transport ventilator as soon as feasible by CCATT to ensure that the patient can be safely maintained on transport ventilator \nand allow time for an ABG to be drawn.  \nii. Medical Teams that are preparing patients with respiratory dysfunction for transport within \nthe next 24hrs should practice conservatively in managing these patients before flight.  \n1. Chest tubes should be left in place, particularly for patients on positive pressure \nventilation. As patients climb in altitude, any residual pneumothorax may re- expand. \nAdditionally, patients may require increasing ventilatory pressures to achieve \noxygenat ion goals at altitude, putting the patient at risk for recurrent/worsening \npneumothorax. \n2. Patients on a ventilator typically should not be extubated immediately prior to transport. The decreased partial pressure of oxygen at altitude may not be easily \novercome with non -invasive oxygenation.  Additionally, transport can be painful and \nmay requir e higher doses of pain medication.  Both factors put a recently extubated \npatient at risk for respiratory insufficiency and reintubation.  \niii. Review CXR  \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   5 1. Note ETT depth and ensure correlation with CXR  \n2. Note invasive line positioning  \n3. Consider repeating CXR if more than 12 hrs. old or if clinical conditions have changed.  \niv. Secure ET tube using a dedicated securing device.  \n1. If burns or facial trauma preclude this, consider securing tube to upper lateral incisor \nand adjoining canine tooth using silk suture or wire. Umbilical tape is also acceptable.  \n2. Be certain that lips and tongue are not injured by device.  \nv. Avoid exposing airway to atmospheric pressure during ventilator changeover if PEEP is ≥ 10cm \nH2O. \n1. Lung de-recruitment occurs rapidly with exposure to atmospheric pressure.  \n2. Gently clamp ET tube using a Kelly clamp while the circuit is broken for ventilator \nchangeover.  \n3. Pad the Kelly clamp with tape or short pieces of rubber tubing to avoid damage to the \nET tube.  \n4. Do not clamp wire reinforced tubes as they will kink permanently.  \nvi. All ventilated patients should have a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) in place.  \nvii. Check ET tube cuff pressure prior to departure.  \n1. Proper ET tube cuff inflation is mandatory to avoid aspiration, de-recruitment and \nventilator malfunction (pressure too low) or damage to tracheal mucosa (pressure too \nhigh).  \n2. Palpating ET tube cuff is inaccurate and should not be relied upon to estimate cuff pressure. Use a cuff manometer . \n3. Goal Cuff Pressure is typically 20 –  30 cm H 2O (15-22 mm Hg). Alternatively, the Minimal \nLeak Test should be used in pediatric patients and can be used safely in adults.  \n4. ET tube cuffs should be filled with air. Do not use saline.  \nviii. All ventilated patients should have the head of bed elevated at least 30° unless there is a contraindication. \n1. Most patients will not have a contraindication. Ask the sending physician or \nneurosurgeon for clarification if necessary.  \n2. The backrest designed for the NATO litter is the most appropriate way to elevate the \nhead of bed.  \nix. All ventilated patients should have continuous ETCO 2 monitoring.  \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical Judgement   6 1. Use caution interpreting the absolute value of the ETCO 2 as it may not accurately reflect \nPaCO 2. \na. The difference between PaCO 2 and ETCO2 reflects dead space. A difference of 3 -5 \nmmHg is normal in healthy patients. In critically ill patients this number can vary  \nsignificantly and change rapidly with various disease processes. \nb. The true value is the ability to immediately detect circuit disconnections and \nventilator failures by observing changes in the waveform and to identify trends in CO2 that may prompt arterial blood gas measurement.  \n2. Should CPR be necessary, ETCO 2 monitoring may be used to evaluate the adequacy of \nchest compressions, the goal is greater than 10 mmHg at a minimum and 20 mmHg ideally. \n3. Additionally, ETCO2 waveforms may offer insight into a variety of respiratory dynamics.  \nx. All ventilated patients require gastric decompression at take-off and landing.  \n1. Large bore oro -gastric tubes are preferred to large bore naso -gastric tubes for \ndecompression to reduce the risk of sinusitis.  \n2. For babies and others at risk of hypoglycemia, weigh the risks and benefits of discontinuing enteral feeds. If gastric feeds must be terminated, monitor patient for hypoglycemia and/or have a plan to mitigate this with dextrose containing fluids. \n3. Patients with post pyloric feeding tubes and secured airways (ETT or Trach with cuff inflated) have a very low risk of aspiration and may continue enteral feeding.  \n \nBASIC VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT  \n \na. Mode of Ventilation  \ni. Avoiding injurious ventilator settings is far more important than the mode of ventilation.  \nii. There is no outcome-based evidence favoring one mode of ventilation over another.  \niii. Patients in the landmark ARDSNet ARMA trial were all ventilated in volume assist -control \nventilation and many clinicians choose to use this mode primarily. \n1. However, pressure control has some theoretical advantages.  \na. A decelerating flow waveform is more comfortable for the patient and may improve gas mixing. This is only available in PC mode on the 731 ventilator. VC mode on the \n731 ventilator only allows square wave flow, unlike most ICU ventilators.  \nb. Inverting I:E ratio is an option for increasing the mean airway pressure (and thus \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   7 improving oxygenation). This is easier to manage in PC than VC.  \nc. Setting a Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) ensures that the Plateau Pressure (Pplat) \nwill remain below PIP.  \n2. A theoretical drawback to Pressure Control is that close attention must be paid to tidal \nvolumes delivered as they can change over time due to changes in the patient’s \nphysiology. \nb. Ventilator Settings  \ni. Initial approach and assessment  \n1. For patients on a ventilator, start by trying to match prior vent settings  \n2. Place patients with respiratory dysfunction on the transport vent early to verify stability  \n3. The presence of any of the below potentially harmful vent settings or patient \ncharacteristics should prompt consultation with the ECMO transport team.  Consider \nconsultation even if ECMO transport is not possible as they can offer additional \nmanagement suggestions.  \na. Pplat > 32  \nb. PIP > 40  \nc. FiO2 > 60% on appropriate PEEP  \nd. PEEP > 14  \ne. pH < 7.25 despite attempts to increase MV  \nf. P/F Ratio < 150 despite on appropriate PEEP and FiO2  \n4. Patients will likely require increased PEEP or FiO2, and possibly MV at altitude. Ensure that there is room to safely titrate up all vent settings by approximately 20% at altitude.  \n5. See below for guidance for newly intubated patients or patients not tolerating current \nvent settings.  \nii. Tidal Volume (V T) \n1. Tidal volume should be based on predicted body weight (PBW) according to: PBW = \n50+2.3 (height in inches – 60) for males. Refer to Appendix B.  (May use “wingspan” \ninstead of height).  \na. Goal V T is 4-8 cc/kg based on predicted body weight.  \nb. Patients with lung injury or concern for potential lung injury should have a target V T  \n6 ml/kg PBW  \nc. Other patients may find a V T of 8cc/kg more comfortable than lower volumes.  This \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   8 target may be appropriate as long as PIP ≤ 40 cmH 2O and Pplat  ≤ 30 cmH 2O. \nd. If a patient is not tolerating the target V T consider additional sedation and paralytic.  \ne. While V T can be manipulated to control pCO2, the best way to manage pCO2 is to \nalter the respiratory rate.  If adjusting tidal volume, do not increase V T above 8 cc/kg \nto control pCO 2 \niii. Respiratory Rate  \n1. Respiratory rate should be 12 -32 \n2. Adjust the respiratory rate to achieve a pH between 7.35 and 7.45.  If this goal cannot \nbe reached, permissive hypercapnia is appropriate for ARDS patients without TBI.  \nTolerance of pH as low as 7.25 may be appropriate for transport and allow for avoidanc e \nof injurious vent settings.  See section on “Permissive Hypercapnia” below.  If in doubt, \nconsult the ECMO team.  \n3. The pH is more important that the actual pCO2  ***Not applicable to TBI patients***  \n4. Patients with baseline CO2 retention will have a normal pH at elevated pCO2, this is normal.  \niv. Volume Control (VC)  \n1. Start at 6 -8 ml/kg PBW for patients with minimal lung disease \n2. Start at 6 ml/kg PBW for patients with respiratory dysfunction  \n3. Adjust Respiratory Rate (RR) for a Minute Ventilation (MV) that achieves the goal pH and PaCO2.   \n4. Check Pplat, if >30, V T can be titrated down to 4ml/kg to reach a safe Pplat.  A V T of 4 \nml/kg PBW is usually uncomfortable for the patient and may require increased sedation.  \n5. If PIP is elevated, consider increasing inspiratory time.  Other measures to increase airway diameter including suctioning or bronchodilators may be considered in the \nappropriate clinical circumstances.  \nv. Pressure Control (VC)  \n1. Switching to PC mode allows the respiratory provider to target a safe upper limit for Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and Plateau Pressure (Pplat).  \na. PIP is greater than or equal to Pplat in PC mode.  If flow equals zero at the end of inspiration, PIP = Pplat, otherwise Pplat < PIP.  \n2. Plateau pressures equal to or less than 30 cmH 2O are thought to be safe \n3. Driving Pressure (ΔP) = Pplat –  PEEP  \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   9 a. Driving Pressures less than 15 mmHg correlate with better outcomes  \nb. Driving Pressure can be titrated up or down to change V T; this is the most direct way \nto change V T. \nc. The Zoll 731 ventilator is not PEEP compensated. Increasing PEEP without changing \nthe PIP will decrease Driving Pressure and V T. \n4. Setting the PIP  \na. Start by setting the vent PIP to 10 cmH 2O above PEEP (Driving pressure of 10 \ncmH 2O) \nb. Quickly titrate the PIP up or down for a target V T of 4-8 ml/kg.  \nc. 8 ml/kg PBW V T may be appropriate for patients without respiratory dysfunction  \nd. Otherwise, for patients with any concern for lung injury, titrate PIP to achieve V T of \n6ml/kg PBW  \ne. Changes of 2 -4 cmH 2O can be made every few breaths. \n5. VT can change quickly in critically ill patients leading to changes in MV/pH/PaCO2.  \na. Providers must be attentive for changes in V T and MV. \nb. Decreases in Pulmonary Compliance will decrease V T \nc. Increases in Pulmonary Resistance may decrease V T \n6. Inspiratory Time can be increased or decreased to change V T \na. Increases in inspiratory time will increase V T \nb. Decreases in inspiratory time will decrease V T \nc. Changes in Respiratory Rate may change inspiratory time which may change V T \nvi. Permissive Hypercapnia –  Patients with hypercarbic respiratory failure (ex. ARDS or COPD) \nmay require permissive hypercapnia to remain in safe pressure ranges on the ventilator.  \n1. Respiratory acidosis is well tolerated, to an extent. Titrating up ventilator pressures can \nbe more harmful than tolerating moderate hypercarbia. \n2. Prioritize lung protective ventilation with Pplat < 30 cmH2 O. \n3. Manipulate respiratory rate to maintain a minimum pH of 7.25.  \n4. Investigate non -respiratory causes of acidosis and treat appropriately  \n5. Bicarbonate administration may help in the treatment of non -anion gap acidosis.  It may \nalso be utilized as a temporizing measure for severe acidosis (pH < 7.15) with concern \nfor high risk of cardiovascular collapse.  However, note that bicarbonate will be  rapidly \nconverted to CO2 requiring increased minute ventilation for clearance, and thus may \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   10 ultimately worsen respiratory acidosis for patients unable to ventilate.  \nvii. Oxygenation  \n1. Oxygen saturation goals should, in general, be between 93 -99%.   \na. While literature supports allowing for oxygen saturation as low as 90%, in the \ntransport environment targeting a saturation of 93% or above allows for an \nincreased degree of safety due to the number of patient handoffs and equipment \nchallenges that can be encountered.  \nb. Oxygen saturation of 100% indicates a PaO2 of 100 mmHg or more and could indicate harmful hyperoxia.  Targeting normoxia of 93 -99% reduces the possibility of \nharm from hyperoxia and preserves a finite resource in flight.    \n2. FiO2 \na. Start at 60% for patients with minimal lung disease \nb. Start at 100% for patients with respiratory dysfunction  \nc. Titrate FiO 2 in coordination with PEEP (see below)  \nd. FiO2 changes can be made rapidly and are best titrated to pulse oximetry, not PaO2  \non ABG.  \ne. Consider increasing FiO 2 by 20% immediately prior to take off in patients with \nmarginal oxygenation  \n3. PEEP  \na. Start PEEP of 5 mm Hg for patients with minimal lung disease  \nb. Start at a PEEP of 10-15 mm Hg for patients with hypoxic respiratory failure  \nc. Attempt to match PEEP and FiO2 per ARDSNet ARMA table in Appendix B  \nd. Increases in PEEP take 30 -60 min to have an effect.  \ne. Decreases in PEEP take effect immediately. If PEEP is decreased too rapidly, it may take 30 -60 min to re -recruit areas of atelectasis \nf. Recruitment Maneuvers may speed response to changes increases in PEEP (see \nbelow)  \ng. Consider low PEEP and High FiO2 for patients with pneumothorax, air leaks from the \nchest tube, or recent lung surgery.  \nh. Recheck PIP and Pplat after titrating PEEP and ensure appropriate V T and MV  \ni. High PEEP can decrease cardiac output and may cause hypotension in hypovolemic \npatients. Additional volume loading may be necessary to maintain hemodynamics.  \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical Judgement   11 c. Alarms  \ni. Alarms should be set to alert the team to malfunctions or changes in physiology without \ncausing frequent false alarms. The following guidance is a starting point, but each team will determine appropriate alarm settings for each mission.  \nii. Suggested initial settings  \n1. High pressure alarm should be set 50% above the baseline PIP (1.5 X current PIP). \n2. Low pressure alarm should be set 50% below the baseline PIP (0.5 X current PIP). \n3. High respiratory rate alarm (731 only) should be set 10 above the patient's respiratory rate.  \n4. Low respiratory rate alarm (731 only) should be set 10 below the set rate.  \n \nONGOING MANAGEMENT  \n \na. Airway Suctioning  \ni. Suctioning every 4 hours is appropriate without copious secretions or mucous plugging.  \nii. Frequent suctioning may lead to lung de-recruitment and worsen gas exchange in patients \nwith ARDS.  \nb. ETT Cuff Pressure  \ni. Significant changes may occur on ascent and descent.  Cuff pressure increases with ascent \nand decreases with descent.  \nii. Cuff pressure should be checked and documented with manometer before departure, at \ncruise altitude, during descent and after landing.  \nc. Management of Oxygen Desaturation  \ni. Increase FiO2 to 100% if patient is desaturating quickly while you work through evaluation.  \n1. FiO2 can be quickly weaned based on SpO2 once the patient is stable  \n2. Rule out equipment malfunction, loss of O2 supply, or circuit disconnect and ensure that \nthe desired FiO 2 is being delivered to the patient  \nii. Confirm ET tube placement is in trachea using ETCO2 and note location at teeth/lip \niii. If desaturation is severe switch immediately to manual bag ventilation with high flow oxygen \nand PEEP valve.  \n1. Suction the airway (consider simultaneous bag ventilation) to verify patency and clear mucous plugs. \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   12 2. Consider the need for ETT exchange if it is difficult to pass a suction catheter through \nthe ETT.  \n3. When attempting to clear thick adherent mucous secretions make sure that the Zoll 330 \nsuction machine is pulling -120 cm H 2O. It is often necessary to TEMPORARILY clamp all \nother devices attached to suction, particularly the pleurevac.  \n4. Be aware that aggressive suctioning can lead to de-recruitment and mucosal injury, worsening hypoxia  \niv. If the patient is dyssynchronous with the ventilator:  \n1. Consider changing the ventilatory mode. \n2. Rule out pneumothorax/hemothorax.  \n3. Review peak pressure trend if using volume cycled ventilation.  \n4. Review V T trend if using pressure control ventilation. V T will decrease if significant \npneumothorax develops and ΔP is not changed.  \n5. Evaluate existing chest tubes for proper function.  \n6. Consider increasing sedation or adding paralytic.  \n7. Evaluate lungs with ultrasound.  \n8. Needle decompression of the chest and placement of a chest tube may be necessary if there is suspicion of pneumothorax and concurrent hemodynamic compromise. \n9. Consider needle decompression of the contralateral lung. Trauma patients are at high \nrisk of bilateral pneumothorax even if only one side of the thorax shows signs of trauma.  \nv. Consider increasing PEEP. Raising PEEP may take 30 min to improve SpO2.  \nvi. Consider recruitment maneuvers after increasing PEEP to next level on titration table.  \n1. Additional lung can sometimes be recruited using sustained inflations (recruitment maneuvers) of the lung, particularly in patients with an increased risk of atelectasis.  \n2. Current data does not support wide -spread use of recruitment maneuvers for hypoxia. \nThe risks of barotrauma outweigh the minimal benefit seen in most cases and so recruitment maneuvers are largely avoided in routine ICU care.  \n3. Patients with ARDS, recent lung surgery, ongoing air -leak from pneumothorax, or under -\nresuscitation are at high risk for further injury.  \n4. A typical recruitment maneuver consists of inflation to 30 -40 cm H 2O for 30-40 seconds, \nwhich is difficult to do on transport ventilators. \n5. Recruitment maneuvers increase intrathoracic pressure (by design) which can result in \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical  Judgement   13 decreased cardiac output and hypotension.  Monitor blood pressure closely and \nterminate any of the below recruitment maneuvers if hypotension develops.  \n6. Pragmatic recruitment maneuvers on the 731 may be performed by:  \na. Volume control setting:  \ni. Increase peep first to match anticipated final FiO2 setting per ARDSNet  \nii. Increase tidal volume to 10ml/kg for 1 minute then reduce to prior volume  \nb. Pressure control setting:  \ni. Increase peep first to match anticipated final FiO2 setting per ARDSNet  \nii. Set PIP to 30 cm H 20 \niii. Manual breath hold for 20sec on two consecutive breaths as tolerated by patient  \n7. Recruitment maneuver can be performed with bag-valve manual ventilation.  \na. Set PEEP valve on bag -valve unit to 20 cm H 2O. \nb. Deliver five sequential breaths, each held for 5 -8 seconds. \nc. Clamp endotracheal tube while switching between ventilator and bag. Exposure to \natmospheric pressure will quickly result in lung de-recruitment, hypoxemia and \nincreased ventilator induced lung injury. \nd. Monitoring Oxygen Utilization  \ni. When using PTLOX, periodically check amount of oxygen consumed.  \nii. Oxygen consumption may vary between ventilators, even with the same settings. \niii. Leaks in system may cause excessive oxygen consumption.  \niv. Comparing actual to predicted oxygen consumption will allow early detection of excess \nutilization that may necessitate troubleshooting, changes in management or diverting aircraft \nin extreme cases.   \nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical Judgement   14 APPENDIX A: OXYGEN REQUIREMENTS  \n \n  \n\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical Judgement   15 APPENDIX B: PEEP, TV, AND  FiO2 V ENTILATION OF PATIENTS WITH ARDS  \n \nMale Patients – mls per Kg  \n \n \nFemale Patients – mls per Kg  \n \n \nPEEP to FiO 2 \n \n  \n\nMechanical Ventilation during Critical Care Air Transport                                                                                 CPG: 48                           \nGuidelines Only/Not a substitute for Clinical Judgement   16 APPENDIX C: TROUBLESHOOTING – DOPE ALGORITHM  \n \nAlarm  DOPE  Possible  Cause  Troubleshooting  \nHigh \nPressure  D Mainstem \nintubation  If the tube  has advanced  and unilateral  ventilation  is \nconfirmed,  retract  the tube  to proper  depth  using  bougie technique to maintain \nplacement.  \nHigh \nPressure  D Esophageal intubation  If the tube is advanced and unilateral ventilation is not present,  rule out \nesophageal  intubation.

Pain is universally present in combat casualties and an obligatory part of trauma care.\n2. Adequate pain control is an essential part of care from point of injury to continental United States (CONUS) care; it\nhas been shown to reduce the development of chronic pain syndromes and reduce the incidence of post -traumatic\nstress disorder.\n3. Prior to escalating any treatment for pain, consider other potential physiologic etiologies.\n4. Orders for the treatment of pain and anxiety should include set goals and the minimum amount of medication\nnecessary to achieve the goals should be used.\n5. The Acute Pain Medicine Service (APMS) should be established and be an integral part of casualty care starting at\nthe Role 3 facility.\n6. The primary mission of the APMS is the provision of effective pain control as well as the treatment and prevention\nof anxiety and delirium in any injured patient. Standardized and validated scoring systems should be used for\nassessment and to guide therapi es. (See appendices .)\n7. An APMS should include a tracking system that lists all patients on the service, their injuries,  and therapeutic\ninterventions along with treatment plan comments.\n8. Refer to Table 1 in Appendix A  for overall pharmacologic treatment guidelines for agitation/anxiety, and delirium\n(PAD).\n9. See Appendix H  for a sample order set including medication options and dosing.\n10. Intermittent dosing of analgesics and anxiolytics should be instituted prior to continuous dosing and continuous\ndrips should be stopped daily to obtain a reliable physical examination and to perform a spontaneous breathing\ntrial in ventilated patients who  are potential candidates for extubation.\n11. In casualties with injuries that predispose them to compartment syndrome, the decision to use regional anesthesia\nmust be carefully considered if the patients have not previously undergone fasciotomies. Regional anesthesia must\nbe closely monitored in orde r to not mask a compartment syndrome.\nGOALS\nThis CPG provides an evidenced based framework for the management of PAD in injured combat casualties. It is a moral,\nmedical, and operational imperative to provide state of the art pain services to combat casualties, in so forth reducing the\nincidence of chronic pain syndromes, PTSD, and long - term narcotic dependency. This process begins at the point of injury\nand Role 1 facility. As the casualty moves along the care continuum, pain and anxiety must continue to be addressed with\nthe increasing capabilitie s inherent to the military Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). In this CPG, emphasis is placed on Role\n3 care, as this is the first MTF that typically is equipped with robust treatment options. Optimal analgesia is a team effort\nand should be coordinated by the trauma surgeon, the APMS consultant, and the critical care consultant in conjunction with\nthe bedside nurse who ultimately delivers therapy and monitors the adequacy of it. This CPG will address the need for an\nAPMS at Role 3 care.1-3 The APMS will be introduced as a necessary adjunct to the Trauma Team. This multidisciplinary\ncollaboration will assess analgesia needs throughout Role 3 care based on injury complexity, trauma burden, risks for\ncoagulopathy / thromboembolic events, anticipated number of s urgical procedures, evacuation plan, logistical constraints,\nand practitioner expertise. It is also important to recognize that pain control should be optimized as a priority over sedati on\nand that the principle of “analgosedation” (i.e. analgesia -based se dation) is a viable solution for critically injured casualties.4\nThis CPG will also delineate specific treatment guidelines between Role 1, Role 2, Role 3, and higher echelons of care. Role 1\ncare guidelines are incorporated from the JTS Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care recommendations.\nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  4 BACKGR OUN D\nPain is universally present in combat casualties. Ensuring that critically injured patients are treated for PAD is not only\nessential in the acute setting but also for preventing potential long -term consequences when they are not addressed\nappropriately.1  Beginning with point of injury , Tactical Combat Casualty Care  (TCCC ), and continuing through the increasing\nechelons of care, active management of PAD, encompassing prevention, assessment, and treatment are medically and\nmorally imperative. Given the magn itude of injury burden in our combat casualty population, surgical and life -sustaining\ntreatment priorities may conflict, take precedent,  or overshadow the assessment and active management of PAD.\nGuidelines should be established understanding that sound clinical judgment, logistic and personnel constraints, and the\noperational context may dictate the use of other methods. Adequate early pa in control to reduce posttraumatic stress\ndisorder and ongoing pain control is an obligatory part of trauma care. The s tress response involves a well -established\nsequence of physiologic and molecular events that include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, gastrointestinal\nileus, hypercoagulability, protein catabolism, immunosuppression, among other undesirable con sequences that delay or\nprevent a wounded warrior’s full rehabilitation and recovery.5,6  Effective pain management requires coordination of all\nmedical providers from the point of injury throughout the echelons of care and the medical evacuation system.\nPain is frequently accompanied by anxiety and delirium in critically injured patients and the medications utilized to treat\nthese conditions may paradoxically prolong or even exacerbate them. A multimodal approach to pain control can reduce the\ntotal dosag e and duration of narcotics required, minimize,  or even eliminate complications associated with narcotics and\nreduce narcotic dependence.7  Adjuncts such as acetaminophen, ketamine, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),\ncontinuous peripheral nerv e infusions, and continuous epidural infusions greatly increase patient safety and the\neffectiveness of narcotics while reducing the side effects.\nTEAM -BASED  MULTIM O DAL  APPROACH\nThe adoption of a team -based multimodal approach to the management of pain, anxiety and delirium most feasibly\ncommences at the level of Role 3 care and should be continued throughout Role  4 and subsequent CONUS care.  This\nmultimodal management includes the establishment of an APMS starting at the Role 3 and continuing for the duration of\nthe casualty’s care.  The physician with the most, and preferentially extensive, training and experience in pain medicine\n(usually an Anesthesiologist) directs the APMS and serves as the consultant. At the Role 3, the APMS is staffed from existing\npersonnel and should include a  physician consultant, a chief pain nurse, and ward pai n nurse champions.1,8,9\nThe APMS personnel should interact directly and frequently with the primary treating service, typically led by a trauma\nsurgeon and/or intensivist. This is best accomplished by including the APMS in daily rounds led by the primary trauma team\nand by incorp orating the assessment and plan for pain management as a mandatory component of patient rounds. If is it\nnot feasible to incorporate the APMS into trauma rounds, then the APMS is responsible for daily pain medicine rounds, pain\nmedicine consults, and repor ts to the trauma team leader.\nThe APMS should be available to all patients that are admitted to the Role 3. The primary  mission of the APMS is to provide\neffective alleviation of pain to promote functional rehabilitation enabling return -to-duty and facilitate movement through\nthe evacuation chain, as well as assisting in the prevention and treatment of anxiety and delirium  in any injured patient.\nThere are standardized and validated scoring systems for the assessment of PAD,  including the:\n▪ DoD/VA Pain Rating Scale ( Appendix B  and Appendix C )\n▪ Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) ( Appendix D )\n▪ Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) ( Appendix E )\nThe Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and supplemental questions have undergone, and continue to undergo,\nvalidation studies.10  The DVPRS should be used to assess pain, the RASS score should be used to assess anxiety, and the\nCAM should be used to assess the presence of delirium. Consider potential surgical and medical causes of increased pain\nand anxiety prior to treating.\nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 The APMS should consist of an interdisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists that is available 24/7. In\naddition to participating in daily trauma rounds, the APMS consultant is responsible for the coordination of pain\nmanagement plans with t he validating flight surgeon, medical evacuation team, and the receiving MTF. Additionally, the\nAPMS should include a tracking and performance improvement system that follows all patients on the service listing their\ninjuries, therapeutic interventions, an d care plan; this should be electronically maintained along the continuum of care.\nTo facilitate implementation and utilization of the APMS a ‘pain treatment cart’ with all of the needed supplies for regional\nanesthesia should be stocked in the anesthesia services section. The regional anesthesia area should have immediate access\nto Adva nced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) medications and 20% intralipid. An ultrasound machine should be available\nfor the APMS and anesthesia use to facilitate regional blocks. APMS order sets can be utilized and should include pain\nmanagement goals using the minimum amount of medication to achieve patient comfort. The goal for patients with\ndelirium is to achieve a delirium free state as measured by the CAM.\nSee Appendix H  for a sample order set including medication options and dosing.\nSee Table 1 in Appendix A  for a summary list of recommendations.\nPREVEN TION\nPA I N\nPain, as a product of trauma, cannot be prevented, per se, but there are many mechanisms for minimizing and managing\npain. This begins with interrupting the mechanism and treating the injury, which are beyond the scope of this CPG; however,\nan essential pa rt of long -term pain control is early and adequate intervention at the point of injury.1,11 -13  Pain recognition\nand assessment should be a routine part of combat casualty management followed by prompt intervention. Early\ninterventions are essential to pre vent the psychological and biochemical consequences of pain and pain related\nphenomenon, and to reduce the risk of chronic pain syndrome.4  Orders for the treatment of pain and anxiety should\ninclude set goals and the minimum amount of medication necessary to achieve the goals should be used. These goals are\ndetermined by the need to achieve patient comfort and safety.\nA N X I E T Y   A N D   D E L I R I U M\nSimilarly, the prevention of anxiety, agitation and delirium begin with recognition. All combat casualties are at risk for\nanxiety, which they may attempt to conceal or not disclose. As with pain prevention, management of the underlying\netiology, including  pain, hypoxia, metabolic abnormalities, and medications effects are essential principals. Disorientation to\nplace and time as a result of unconsciousness, sedation, and loss of awareness resulting from hospitalization contribute to\nPAD. This can be preven ted with frequent and systemic efforts at reorientation and maintenance of normal sleep patterns.4\nInterventions to promote healthy, REM sleep include exposure to bright light or sunlight during normal daytime hours and\nenforced darkness during normal nighttime  hours. Orders should be written for scheduled periods of minimal or no\ndisruption during normal sleep hours and allowing patients to use earplugs during sleep to minimize noise disruption.\nConversely, patients should be provided with hearing aids or eyeglasses , as needed, to combat sensory deprivation. Victims\nof close proximity blast exposure sho uld be presumed to have some degree of hearing loss and undergo an audiology\nevaluation. Intermittent dosing of analgesics and anxiolytics should be instituted prior to continuous dosing. Patients who\nrequire dosing more frequently than every 2 hours shoul d be placed on continuous dosing titrated to their goal.\nEfforts to prevent delirium in critically injured patients include Awakening and Breathing Coordination (ABC), non -\npharmacologic Delirium (D) interventions, and early Exercise (E) and mobility. The ABCDEs should be incorporated into\ntreatment care plans fo r all intensive care unit  (ICU) patients starting no later than the Role 3.4,14  Propofol is an option for\nshort term sedation in acutely agitated patients. It has rapid onset and it is also cleared rapidly.\nPropofol has been associated with hypotension which may be related to intravascular depletion. It is dissolved in a 10% lipid\nsolution which should be accounted for when calculating calorie requirements. Propofol is an excellent drug for ICU patients\nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 scheduled to undergo Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) missions. When used for transport, Propofol should only be\nadministered to intubated patients.\nSpontaneous Breathing Trials (SBT) should be performed daily. Physical and occupational therapy should be initiated as soon\nas possible or at minimum 72 hours after intubation.14,15\nThere is insufficient evidence that prophylactic administration of antipsychotics to the general  ICU population prevents\ndelirium and, therefore, we make no recommendation for it.16  Benzodiazepines, although potentially useful for control of\nagitation, may increase delirium and should be avoided or minimized in patients experiencing or at increased risk for\ndelirium.\nEVALUATION  OF  PAIN\nSome level of pain is present in all combat casualties. While the pain may be initially masked by the intensity of the\nsituation, the combat medic or when the patient reaches the first level of care should assess the level of pain. Seriously\ninjured patien ts who are not intubated should be assessed every 1 -4 hours for the presence of pain. All patients who are\nintubated need to be continuously monitored for adequate analgesia. Signs of inadequate pain control in the intubated\npatient include tachycardia, hypertension,  and agitation. However – it is imperative that other causes be excluded such as\nearly compartment syndrome, missed injuries, or impending physiologic decline. If the patient is appropriately\ncommunicative, then using the DoD/VA Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) a nd Supplemental Questions as quantifiers can facilitate\nevaluation and trends.3,10  All combat casualties will have a pain score recorded on admission to a Level  III facility and as part\nof routine care while in the ICU.\nEVALUATION  OF  AGITATION  AND  DELIRIUM\nThe assessment of anxiety, agitation, delirium as well as pain can be complicated by the presence of traumatic brain injury\n(TBI). TBI, in addition to overall injury burden, and therapeutic interventions can affect the evaluation for agitation as we ll as\nimpede an accurate neurologic assessment. Moderate to severe TBI patients are at particularly high risk for having atypical\nand/or paradoxical reactions to both sedating and stimulating agents.17,18  In addition, the reactions to individual agents and\ntheir  overall impact on the TBI patient in terms of pain, alertness, agitation, anxiety, and delirium may change drastically\nover relatively short periods of time as their injury and cognitive status evolves. The following tools help with pain\nevaluation: Richm ond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM); they are included as\nAppendi x D and Appendix E.\nTREATMENT  OF  PAIN:  GENERAL  INFO RMATIO N\nAs previously stated,  pain is a universal symptom of the combat injured patient and must be managed early and effectively.\nAdequate early pain control has been shown to reduce post -traumatic stress disorder and ongoing pain control is an\nobligatory part of trauma care. Inadequ ate treatment results in undesirable consequences that delay or prevent a wounded\nwarrior’s full rehabilitation and recovery.\nNon -pharmacologic pain therapies should be considered first -line treatment for mild to moderate pain or an adjunct to\nopioid medications. This includes battlefield acupuncture when administered by an appropriately qualified clinician and\nsupplies are available. (See Appendix F .)\nWith regards to specific opioid medications, any opioid available can be titrated to equal effectiveness for achieving desire d\npain control. This CPG is going to emphasize the use of Ketamine throughout the deployed continuum of care. Ketamine is a\nvery eff ective analgesic either by itself or as an adjunct to opioid analgesia and can be used to reduce the total narcotic\nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 burden.19,20  Ketamine, in parenteral doses of 0.15 -0.3 mg/kg, has been shown to reduce pain scores, total narcotic use, and\nneed for rescue medication when used with morphine for acute pain control.20\nROLE  1  TREATMENT  OF  PAIN\nThe Role I pain treatment guidelines described here are adopted directly from the most recent protocols developed by the\nDepartment of Defense’s Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC), available online at Deployed Medicine .\nCurrent guidelines, with full course material and supporting documentation,  are available through a Common Access Card\nenabled webpage from the Military Health System ( https://mhs.health.mil/References/REF_TCCC.cshtml  ).\nAdditionally, the Journal of the Special Operations Medical Association maintains free access to the current protocols\n(https://www.jsomonline.org/TCCC.html  ).21,22  See Appendix H  for a sample order set including medication options and\ndosing.\nAnalgesia on the battlefield should generally be achieved using one of three options, per the TCCC triple analgesia protocol.\nThis is an abbreviated presentation of that protocol. The detailed description can be obtained via websites described above.\n▪ Option 1 , for mild to moderate pain when the casualty is still able to fight , should include the TCCC Combat pill\npack with acetaminophen and meloxicam given simultaneously.\n▪ Option 2 , for mild to moderate pain when the casualty is not in shock or respiratory distress, and the casualty is not\nat significant risk of developing either condition, should include Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) 800 ug.\nNaloxone (0.4 mg IV or IM) should be available when using opioid analgesics.\n▪ Option 3 , for moderate to severe pain when the casualty is in hemorrhagic shock or respiratory distress or the\ncasualty is at significant risk of developing either condition, should include ketamine 50 mg IM or IN or ketamine\n20 mg slow IV or IO. Ketamine doses can be repeated every 30 minutes for IM or IN and every 20 minutes for IV or\nIO administration.\nCasualties should be disarmed after being given OTFC and always disarmed after receiving ketamine. Documentation of a\nmental status exam using the Alert, Verbal, Pain, And Unresponsive (AVPU) method should be performed prior to and after\nadministering opioids or ketamine, and recorded on the TCCC Card (DD Form 1380, J un 2014). Ketamine may be a useful\nadjunct to reduce the amount of opioids required to provide effective pain relief. It is safe to give ketamine to a casualty\nwho has previously received morph ine or OTFC. IV Ketamine should be given over one minute.\nROLE  2  TREATMENT  OF  PAIN\nDamage Control Surgery is provided at Role 2. An anesthesiologist and/or certified registered nurse anesthetist who will be\non staff and in conjunction with the surgeons, will be responsible for perioperative pain management. Role 2s differ in the\ncapability with some consisting of a single operating room bed and a single post -operative ICU bed while others have\nattache d Emergency Care and Post -Operative Holding Capacity.\nIn the more austere Role 2, pain should be managed with intravenous opioids and ketamine titrated as needed to provide\nadequate pain control; if dysphoric symptoms emerge with ketamine, then a small amount of benzodiazepine should be\nadministered.\nMore robust Role 2s will have additional personnel, equipment, and supplies available. At these locations, the capability\nmight exist for peripheral nerve blocks, which could be performed by the anesthesia provider or by the orthopedic surgeon\nassigned to the unit. Infusion pumps may also be available for continuous opioid infusions in critically injured patients, with\ndosage titrated as needed to provide adequate pain control. Patients on infusions require close monitoring in an ICU setting.\nSome of these more robust Role 2s with attached ward holding may have Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pumps that can\nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 be used by patients to manage their pain. Pain should be adequately controlled prior to starting PCA; the patient can then\nuse the PCA for self -dosing as needed for pain. The starting doses for PCAs are as follows:\n▪ Morphine PCA in adults is 1 -3 mg with 10–20-minute  lockout .\n▪ Hydromophone PCA in adults is 0.1 -0.3 mg with 10–20-minute  lockout .\n▪ Fentanyl PCA is 15 -25 mcg with 10–20-minute  lockout.\nPatients on PCA require monitoring by nursing staff. Naloxone must be available to treat respiratory distress that may occur\nsecondary to opioids.\nROLE  3  TREATMENT  OF  PAIN\nRegional anesthesia procedures should be performed in a monitored setting where nursing staff is available to help with\npatient care and provide appropriate recovery services for the patients. The APMS  (discussed extensively above) should\nmaintain and provide input for standing orders to include:\n▪ Continuous epidural and peripheral nerve catheter infusion and single injection epidural or intrathecal narcotics.\n▪ Intravenous PCA Orders. Fentanyl, hydromorphone, and morphine are the narcotic agents of choice. (Meperidine\n(Demerol) is not an approved compound for repeated PCA dosing as the metabolite normeperidine reduces the\nseizure threshold.)\nLow dose ketamine infusions have profound analgesic effects with very minimal side effects. The anti - inflammatory effects\nof ketamine may also attenuate the systemic inflammatory response seen in trauma.13,23,24  Ketamine binds the N-methyl -D-\naspartate receptor and in addition to having direct analgesic properties, it also decreases the total dose of narcotics needed\nfor adjuvant pain control.\nKetamine infusions should be made as follows:\n▪ 250 mg of Ketamine in 250 ml of normal saline.\n▪ For patients who are 70 kg or greater and less than 60 years old, start infusions at 10 mg per hour in the setting of\nacute and neuropathic pain.\n▪ Patients > 60-year -old or <70kg should receive 100 micrograms/kg/hour of ketamine in the setting of acute or\nneuropathic pain.\n▪ Custom orders may be titrated by the attending anesthesiologist or critical care physician.\nEPID UR AL  CATHETERS\nNeuraxial analgesia can be a very effective pain treatment in the injured warfighter, but special care must be taken to ensur e\nthat it is provided safely. Standard preservative free local anesthetics include ropivacaine and bupivacaine . The standard\nmedication for aeromedical evacuation is 0.2% ropivacaine with sufficient volume for 3 days. Patients should be on stable\ndoses of infusions prior to Aeromedical Evacuation ( AE) transportation. The risk/benefit of epidural placement must be\nconsidered in the inj ured combat casualty who is also at risk for venous thromboembolic events.  While all antiplatelet and\nanticoagulant medications increase the risk of bleeding, unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin\n(LMWH) use in patients undergoing epidural anesthesia greatly increases the risk of epidural hematoma, which can lead to\nparalysis. The APMS  should maintain and provide input for standing orders to include:\n1 All catheters should receive a 3 ml test dose of local anesthetic containing at least 1:400,000 epinephrine.\n2 LMWH and UFH use in patients undergoing epidural anesthesia increases the risk of spinal or epidural hematoma,\nwhich may cause long term or permanent paralysis. We recommend against the use of LMWH in AE patients given\nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9 the increased motion of delivery catheters during patient transport and resulting increased risk for spinal and\nepidural hematoma formation.\n3 Before placement of an epidural  catheter:\na. Prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 12 hours.\nb. Low-dose prophylactic UFH should be held for 4 -6 hours.\nc. Therapeutic LMWH should be held for at least 24 hours.\nd. Therapeutic UFH should be held for at least 24 hours and the coagulation status assessed.\n4 With an epidural catheter in place:\na. The maximum recommended prophylactic dose of LMWH is 40mg SQ daily .\nb. The maximum recommended prophylactic dose of UFH is 5000U SQ TID .\nc. The initial dose of once daily prophylactic LMWH should not be given until 12 hours after catheter placement.\nSubsequent daily doses of prophylactic LMWH should start no sooner than 24 hours after the first dose.\nd. The initial dose of low -dose prophylactic UFH can be given immediately after catheter placement .\ne. Twice daily dosing of prophylactic LMWH, therapeutic UFH, and therapeutic LMWH are not recommended.\n5 Before epidural catheter removal:\na. Prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 12 hours.\nb. Low-dose prophylactic UFH should be held for 4 -6 hours.\n6 After epidural catheter removal:\na. Administration of prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 4 hours.\nb. Administration of low -dose prophylactic UFH can occur immediately.\nc. Administration of therapeutic LMWH should be held for at least 4 hours\nd. Administration of therapeutic UFH should be held for 1 hour.\nThese recommendations are consistent with the most recent ASRA (American Society of Regional Anesthesia) guidelines for\nthe prevention of epidural hematoma.2\nNote : Given that our patients are transported through a spectrum of care and across thousands of miles, the\nimplementation of regional anesthesia should be integrated throughout the trauma system and must be safe and effective.\nAn anesthesia provider is respon sible for the initial placement and dosing of an epidural catheter. Only members of the\nAPMS can change the dosing or infusion rate.\nAppendix G  is a summary of the ASRA  guidelines as they relate to use of LMWH in combat casualties. The ASRA guidelines\nwere originally developed for use of LMWH in the perioperative course.\nAdditionally, these recommendations change on a frequent basis; https://www.asra.com/   should be consulted for the most\ncurrent recommendations.\nPERIPH ERAL NERVE   CATHETERS\n1 All catheters should undergo a local anesthetic test dose containing 1:400,000 epinephrine.\n2 For patients undergoing deep plexus or deep peripheral block, we recommend that recommendations regarding\nneuraxial techniques be similarly applied.  For patients undergoing other plexus or peripheral techniques, we\nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  10 recommend management (performance, catheter maintenance, and catheter removal) based on site\ncompressibility, vascularity, and consequences of bleeding, should it occur.\n3 Each patient should have no more than two catheters and the total dose of 0.2% Ropivacaine should not exceed 20\nml per hour.\n4 Regional anesthesia patients should be recovered by standard Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) criteria.\nPatients with epidurals and peripheral nerve blocks should be held in recovery until they meet standard discharge criteria\nfrom PACU and ICU. Patients with peripheral nerve blocks and epidural catheters that have met discharge criteria from ICU\nand PACU ma y be managed on the floor. Any patient with an epidural catheter or peripheral nerve block must be closely\nmonitored for signs or symptoms of compartment syndrome (see below). No narcotics will be added to the peripheral nerve\nblock or epidural infusions g iven the ongoing revision of validation for air transport by the U.S. Air Force (USAF).\nTREATMENT  OF  ANXIETY  AND  AGITATION\nGiven the nature of combat injuries and the environment of care, both agitation and anxiety can be expected and should be\npreemptively managed. In a patient with normal hemodynamics, propofol is a good option for short -term sedation.\nPropofol does not provide analgesia; it is the most commonly used medication when sedation is required for ICU patients\nand CCAT transports due to its rapid onset and clearance. It is a gamma -aminobutyric acid  agonist with rapid onset and\nclearance. Propofol can cause hypotensi on and should be used with caution in patients with intravascular depletion.\nPropofol is dissolved in a 10% lipid solution. It is an excellent drug for ICU patients scheduled to undergo aeromedical\nevacuation. Propofol should only be administered to patien ts who have a definitive airway (endotracheal tube,\ntracheostomy), are hemodynamically stable and are continuously monitored by trained personnel.4,25,26\nDexmedetomidine  is being used with increasing frequency in ICU patients and occasionally for transport. It minimally\ndecreases respiration, so it can be used for patients on non -invasive mechanical ventilation or sedation for an awake\nintubation. It has some mild analges ic effects. It should be used with caution in patients with bradycardia or heart block.\nDexmedetomidine is a relatively selective alpha -2 agonist; it is a good option for short -term sedation and anxiolysis.\nDexmedetomidine has minimal impact  on respiratory drive allows for ongoing assessment of the patient’s mental status.4\nClonidine  is an effective drug for treating patients with anxiety and agitation; it is particularly effective for patients with\nhypertension associated with agitation.5,27  Clonidine acts as an alpha -2 adrenergic agonist and also has sedative properties\nthat do not result in respiratory suppression. It may also be used for mild sedation and analgesia.27\nTREATMENT  OF  DELIRIUM\nThe typical antipsychotic haloperidol (Haldol®) and the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine (Seroquel®) are commonly used for\nthe treatment of delirium. Quetiapine can also be used as an anxiolytic; it is particularly effective when used QHS PRN to\nhelp regu late sleep in a patient at risk for anxiety and delirium. Both of these drugs may be associated with prolongation of\nthe QT interval potentially resulting in fatal arrhythmias secondary to torsades des pointes. If these drugs are used, the QT c\ninterval sho uld be monitored with an electrocardiogram (EKG) on a daily basis. They should be discontinued if the QTc\nexceeds 500 msec or the interval increases 60 msec from baseline.4\nPREVEN TING  COM PLIC ATIONS\nMedications should be specifically directed and dosed to achieve a defined goal, for example:\n▪ Achieve a pain score of 4 or less\nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  11 ▪ Maintain sufficient patient consciousness to assess the evolution of injuries by physical exam\n▪ Decrease the need for mechanical ventilation\n▪ Amelioration of symptoms of anxiety, delirium,  or agitation\nSEDATI ON  HOL IDAY  &  INTERMITTENT  MEDICATION  D OSING\nI N T E R M I T T E N T   D O S I N G\nIntermittent dosing of analgesics and anxiolytics, as opposed to continuous dosing, has been shown to reduce the duration\nof mechanical ventilation and intermittent dosing of analgesics and anxiolytics should be instituted prior to continuous\ndosing. Altho ugh many sedative agents are utilized for their short duration of action (e.g. midazolam), administration as a\ncontinuous infusion will often result in a prolonged duration of action and effect due to fat storage an accumulation of acti ve\nmetabolites. It i s recommended that intermitted sedation be used whenever feasible. For patients who require dosing more\nfrequently than every 1 -2 hours, continuous dosing titrated to effect can be used; however, continuous infusions should be\nconverted to intermittent dos ing as early as possible.\nS E D AT I O N   VA C AT I O N S\nDaily interruptions of sedation (“sedation vacations”) have repeatedly demonstrated reduction in the duration of\nmechanical ventilation as well as the incidence of ventilator -associated pneumonia.21  Intermittent dosing and daily sedation\nholidays prevent the accumulation of active metabolites, which may impede patient assessment for prolonged periods of\ntime.25,28\n▪ Continuous infusions should be stopped daily to obtain a reliable physical examination, including neurologic\nassessment, and to perform a spontaneous breathing trial in ventilated patients.\n▪ Sedation goals should be assessed every day following sedation holidays and every effort should be made to reduce\ninfusion doses.\nC O N T R A I N D I C AT I O N S   T O   T H E   D A I LY   S E D AT I O N   H O L I D AY:\n▪ Intractable intracranial hypertension.\n▪ Hemodynamic instability.\n▪ Inability to adequately oxygenate or ventilate mechanically ventilated patients.\nSee Appendix H  for a sample order set including medication options and dosing.\nSee Table 1 in Appendix A  for suggested management algorithms.\nLO CAL  ANESTHETIC  TOXICITY\nLocal anesthetic toxicity is extremely rare in a patient who has an established neuraxial or peripheral nerve catheter. If\nsuspected, all local anesthetic infusions should be immediately stopped. Occasionally the presenting symptom is cardiac\narrest. In ca rdiac arrest, the patient should immediately receive 1.5 ml/kg of 20% Intralipid while receiving chest\ncompressions and other ACLS interventions such as airway management. Repeat the bolus 1 -2 times as needed for\npersistent asystole, pulseless electrical activity,  or reemergence of hemodynamic insanity. Increase the infusion rate to 0.5\nmL/kg/min if hemodynamic instability persists or recurs. Continue the infusion for at least 10 min after hemodynamic\nstability is restored; discontinue within 1 hour if possible.\nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  12 Another rare symptom of local anesthetic toxicity is seizure. Once again, the infusion should be stopped, seizure should be\ntreated with an anti -seizure medication and the airway should be controlled if necessary. Much more common symptoms of\nlocal anesthe tic toxicity are tinnitus, anxiety, restlessness, dizziness,  and blurred vision; in the case of these symptoms, the\ninfusion should be stopped.\n1000 ml of 20% Intralipid should accompany patients receiving local anesthetic infusions during transport in the AE system.\nNAUSEA\nNausea is a common side effect of both trauma and the medications used to treat pain, anxiety, and delirium. Consider\nprophylactic treatment whenever possible and treat immediately upon patient report of symptoms. If the patient has\nrecently undergone an e mergency general anesthetic or any type of abdominal surgery, then ensuring that they are not at\naspiration risk is important prior to medication. If there is a concern for gastric distention or any type of obstruction\n(functional or mechanical), then the patient should receive gastric decompression with an nasogastric  tube in additional to\npharmacologic management for nausea.\nOndansetron is a safe antiemetic in the adult population and is increasingly the therapy of choice for acute undifferentiated\nand trauma -related nausea.29  It has no effect on consciousness or the respiratory drive; additionally, at the doses\nrecommended for these patients (4 -8 mg per dose) has no clinically significant effect on QT interval.29-32\nCOMPA RTMENT  SYNDROME\nCompartment syndrome is a well -described complication of traumatic injury; for the purposes of this CPG, only extremity\ncompartment syndrome will be discussed. Definitive treatment is complete surgical release of the extremity compartments\naffected. The APMS consultant and trauma surgeon should h ave a detailed discussion regarding patients who are at high risk\nfor compartment syndrome. Pain control may mask the typical early sign of compartment syndrome: increased pain in the\ncompartment. Any patient at risk for extremity compartment syndrome who is awake and has an increased pain medication\nrequirement should be promptly and thoroughly assessed for increased compartment pressure. For patients with regional\nor neuraxial analgesia affecting an extremity that is felt to be at risk for compartment syn drome, more frequent clinical\nassessments and monitoring of the extremity are warranted. If the patient is unable to reliably detect and report pain and\nthere are any clinical or examination findings concerning for a compartment syndrome, then bedside asse ssment of\ncompartment pressures or performance of a fasciotomy should be done promptly. If there is any concern for compartment\nsyndrome, then full compartment release with fasciotomies must be completed prior to aeromedical transportation. Newer\nmonitorin g technologies such as near infrared spectroscopy; have shown some promise in early noninvasive detection of\ncompartment syndrome; however, they are not currently the standard of care.\nAIR  EVACUATION  CONSIDER ATIONS\nThe USAF Patient Movement Request must state the type of regional anesthesia being utilized. All individuals participating\nin the care of the patient should have up -to-date training and experience with regional anesthesia, techniques, medications,\nand equi pment. All equipment associated with the use of regional anesthesia must be approved for flight. The current\ninfusion pump system that has been approved by the USAF for air evacuation is the small portable Ambit pump. Ambit\npumps should be used for epidura l, peripheral nerve catheters, ketamine infusions, narcotic infusions, and patient\ncontrolled anesthesia. For all patients receiving regional anesthesia/analgesia, coordinate with the Trauma Chief, Theater\nValidating Flight Surgeon,  and Theater CCATT Director prior to any planned fixed -wing tactical (Intratheater) or strategic\n(Intertheater) transport to ensure patient safety during flight operations.\nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  13 Patients undergoing prolonged air evacuation are exposed to a multitude of austere environments over a relatively short\nperiod of time. CCATT providers recognize that turbulence, weather, temperature, limited patient access and monitoring\nconstraints make it inherently difficult to maintain sedation and analgesia. It may be necessary to empirically increase\nsedation and pain regimens to maintain a safety margin that protects endotracheal tubes and other invasive devices.

Antiplatelet or oral anticoagulant medications administered in combination with LMWH increases the risk of spinal\nhematoma. ASRA recommends against concomitant administration of antiplatelet drugs, standard heparin, dextran\nor coumadin, regardless of LMWH dosing regimen.\n2. Before placement of an epidural catheter:\na Prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 12 hours.\nb Therapeutic LMWH should be held for at least 24 hours.\n3. With an epidural catheter in place:\na The maximum recommended prophylactic dose of LMWH is 40mg SQ daily\nb The initial dose of once daily prophylactic LMWH should not be given until 12 hours after catheter placement.\nSubsequent daily doses of prophylactic LMWH should start no sooner than 24 hours after the first dose.\nc Twice daily dosing of prophylactic LMWH and therapeutic LMWH are not recommended.\n4. Before epidural catheter removal:\na Prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 12 hours.\n5. After epidural catheter removal:\na Administration of prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 4 hours (and at least 12 hours after catheter\nplacement).\nb Administration of therapeutic LMWH should be held for at least 4 hours (and at least 24 hours after catheter\nplacement).\n6. Neuraxial anesthetic techniques should be avoided in patients who are receiving NSAIDS and LMWH.\n7. For patients undergoing deep plexus or deep peripheral blocks , apply neuraxial recommendations\n8. For patients undergoing other plexus or peripheral techniques, we recommend management (performance,\ncatheter maintenance, and catheter removal) based on site compressibility, vascularity, and consequences of\nbleeding, should it occur.  Twice daily prophylactic LMWH  is acceptable with these types of regional  nerve\ncatheters.\nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  24 APPEN D IX  H:  SEDATIO N  ORDERS\nAllergies:  Weight:  kg\nDiagnosis:\nService:  Attending:\nSEDATION  ANALGESIA  DELIRUM\nSee ICU Sedation  Analgesia  Delirium  Algorithm\nNursing  Orders\n Daily  sedation  hold\n1.

This applies to off -label uses with patients who\nare armed f orces members.\nBACKGROUND\nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of FDA -approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are usually\nnot subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved\ndrugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part\nof clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved\nuses may also be subject to speci al regulations.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS\nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it does not\nimply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard\nof care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care\npractitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for t he\nclinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship.\nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES\nBalanced Discussion\nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by the FDA.\nFurther, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that\nsugge st caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA -issued warnings.\nQuality Assurance Monitoring\nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring of\noutcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.\nInformation to Patients\nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an unusual off -\nlabel use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be given to including in an\nappendix  an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product.\nInformation to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a\nDoD health care practitio ner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with\nsuch use."

 3 SUM MA RY  OF  CARE  \n1. Pain is universally present in combat casualties and an obligatory part of trauma care.  \n2. Adequate pain control is an essential part of care from point of injury to continental United States (CONUS) care; it \nhas been shown to reduce the development of chronic pain syndromes and reduce the incidence of post -traumatic \nstress disorder.  \n3. Prior to escalating any treatment for pain, consider other potential physiologic etiologies.  \n4. Orders for the treatment of pain and anxiety should include set goals and the minimum amount of medication \nnecessary to achieve the goals should be used.  \n5. The Acute Pain Medicine Service (APMS) should be established and be an integral part of casualty care starting at \nthe Role 3 facility.  \n6. The primary mission of the APMS is the provision of effective pain control as well as the treatment and prevention \nof anxiety and delirium in any injured patient. Standardized and validated scoring systems should be used for \nassessment and to guide therapi es. (See appendices .) \n7. An APMS should include a tracking system that lists all patients on the service, their injuries,  and therapeutic \ninterventions along with treatment plan comments.  \n8. Refer to Table 1 in Appendix A  for overall pharmacologic treatment guidelines for agitation/anxiety, and delirium \n(PAD). \n9. See Appendix H  for a sample order set including medication options and dosing.  \n10. Intermittent dosing of analgesics and anxiolytics should be instituted prior to continuous dosing and continuous \ndrips should be stopped daily to obtain a reliable physical examination and to perform a spontaneous breathing \ntrial in ventilated patients who  are potential candidates for extubation.  \n11. In casualties with injuries that predispose them to compartment syndrome, the decision to use regional anesthesia \nmust be carefully considered if the patients have not previously undergone fasciotomies. Regional anesthesia must \nbe closely monitored in orde r to not mask a compartment syndrome.  \nGOALS  \nThis CPG provides an evidenced based framework for the management of PAD in injured combat casualties. It is a moral, \nmedical, and operational imperative to provide state of the art pain services to combat casualties, in so forth reducing the \nincidence of chronic pain syndromes, PTSD, and long - term narcotic dependency. This process begins at the point of injury \nand Role 1 facility. As the casualty moves along the care continuum, pain and anxiety must continue to be addressed with \nthe increasing capabilitie s inherent to the military Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). In this CPG, emphasis is placed on Role \n3 care, as this is the first MTF that typically is equipped with robust treatment options. Optimal analgesia is a team effort  \nand should be coordinated by the trauma surgeon, the APMS consultant, and the critical care consultant in conjunction with \nthe bedside nurse who ultimately delivers therapy and monitors the adequacy of it. This CPG will address the need for an \nAPMS at Role 3 care.1-3 The APMS will be introduced as a necessary adjunct to the Trauma Team. This multidisciplinary \ncollaboration will assess analgesia needs throughout Role 3 care based on injury complexity, trauma burden, risks for \ncoagulopathy / thromboembolic events, anticipated number of s urgical procedures, evacuation plan, logistical constraints, \nand practitioner expertise. It is also important to recognize that pain control should be optimized as a priority over sedati on \nand that the principle of “analgosedation” (i.e. analgesia -based se dation) is a viable solution for critically injured casualties.4 \nThis CPG will also delineate specific treatment guidelines between Role 1, Role 2, Role 3, and higher echelons of care. Role 1 \ncare guidelines are incorporated from the JTS Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care recommendations.  \nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  4 BACKGR OUN D  \nPain is universally present in combat casualties. Ensuring that critically injured patients are treated for PAD is not only \nessential in the acute setting but also for preventing potential long -term consequences when they are not addressed \nappropriately.1  Beginning with point of injury , Tactical Combat Casualty Care  (TCCC ), and continuing through the increasing \nechelons of care, active management of PAD, encompassing prevention, assessment, and treatment are medically and \nmorally imperative. Given the magn itude of injury burden in our combat casualty population, surgical and life -sustaining \ntreatment priorities may conflict, take precedent,  or overshadow the assessment and active management of PAD. \nGuidelines should be established understanding that sound clinical judgment, logistic and personnel constraints, and the \noperational context may dictate the use of other methods. Adequate early pa in control to reduce posttraumatic stress \ndisorder and ongoing pain control is an obligatory part of trauma care. The s tress response involves a well -established \nsequence of physiologic and molecular events that include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, gastrointestinal \nileus, hypercoagulability, protein catabolism, immunosuppression, among other undesirable con sequences that delay or \nprevent a wounded warrior’s full rehabilitation and recovery.5,6  Effective pain management requires coordination of all \nmedical providers from the point of injury throughout the echelons of care and the medical evacuation system.  \nPain is frequently accompanied by anxiety and delirium in critically injured patients and the medications utilized to treat \nthese conditions may paradoxically prolong or even exacerbate them. A multimodal approach to pain control can reduce the \ntotal dosag e and duration of narcotics required, minimize,  or even eliminate complications associated with narcotics and \nreduce narcotic dependence.7  Adjuncts such as acetaminophen, ketamine, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \ncontinuous peripheral nerv e infusions, and continuous epidural infusions greatly increase patient safety and the \neffectiveness of narcotics while reducing the side effects.  \nTEAM -BASED  MULTIM O DAL  APPROACH  \nThe adoption of a team -based multimodal approach to the management of pain, anxiety and delirium most feasibly \ncommences at the level of Role 3 care and should be continued throughout Role  4 and subsequent CONUS care.  This \nmultimodal management includes the establishment of an APMS starting at the Role 3 and continuing for the duration of \nthe casualty’s care.  The physician with the most, and preferentially extensive, training and experience in pain medicine \n(usually an Anesthesiologist) directs the APMS and serves as the consultant. At the Role 3, the APMS is staffed from existing  \npersonnel and should include a  physician consultant, a chief pain nurse, and ward pai n nurse champions.1,8,9 \nThe APMS personnel should interact directly and frequently with the primary treating service, typically led by a trauma \nsurgeon and/or intensivist. This is best accomplished by including the APMS in daily rounds led by the primary trauma team \nand by incorp orating the assessment and plan for pain management as a mandatory component of patient rounds. If is it \nnot feasible to incorporate the APMS into trauma rounds, then the APMS is responsible for daily pain medicine rounds, pain \nmedicine consults, and repor ts to the trauma team leader.  \nThe APMS should be available to all patients that are admitted to the Role 3. The primary  mission of the APMS is to provide \neffective alleviation of pain to promote functional rehabilitation enabling return -to-duty and facilitate movement through \nthe evacuation chain, as well as assisting in the prevention and treatment of anxiety and delirium  in any injured patient. \nThere are standardized and validated scoring systems for the assessment of PAD,  including the:  \n▪ DoD/VA Pain Rating Scale ( Appendix B  and Appendix C ) \n▪ Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) ( Appendix D ) \n▪ Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) ( Appendix E ) \nThe Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and supplemental questions have undergone, and continue to undergo, \nvalidation studies.10  The DVPRS should be used to assess pain, the RASS score should be used to assess anxiety, and the \nCAM should be used to assess the presence of delirium. Consider potential surgical and medical causes of increased pain \nand anxiety prior to treating.  \nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 The APMS should consist of an interdisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists that is available 24/7. In \naddition to participating in daily trauma rounds, the APMS consultant is responsible for the coordination of pain \nmanagement plans with t he validating flight surgeon, medical evacuation team, and the receiving MTF. Additionally, the \nAPMS should include a tracking and performance improvement system that follows all patients on the service listing their \ninjuries, therapeutic interventions, an d care plan; this should be electronically maintained along the continuum of care.  \nTo facilitate implementation and utilization of the APMS a ‘pain treatment cart’ with all of the needed supplies for regional  \nanesthesia should be stocked in the anesthesia services section. The regional anesthesia area should have immediate access \nto Adva nced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) medications and 20% intralipid. An ultrasound machine should be available \nfor the APMS and anesthesia use to facilitate regional blocks. APMS order sets can be utilized and should include pain \nmanagement goals using the minimum amount of medication to achieve patient comfort. The goal for patients with \ndelirium is to achieve a delirium free state as measured by the CAM.  \nSee Appendix H  for a sample order set including medication options and dosing.  \nSee Table 1 in Appendix A  for a summary list of recommendations.  \nPREVEN TION  \nPA I N  \nPain, as a product of trauma, cannot be prevented, per se, but there are many mechanisms for minimizing and managing \npain. This begins with interrupting the mechanism and treating the injury, which are beyond the scope of this CPG; however, \nan essential pa rt of long -term pain control is early and adequate intervention at the point of injury.1,11 -13  Pain recognition \nand assessment should be a routine part of combat casualty management followed by prompt intervention. Early \ninterventions are essential to pre vent the psychological and biochemical consequences of pain and pain related \nphenomenon, and to reduce the risk of chronic pain syndrome.4  Orders for the treatment of pain and anxiety should \ninclude set goals and the minimum amount of medication necessary to achieve the goals should be used. These goals are \ndetermined by the need to achieve patient comfort and safety.  \nA N X I E T Y   A N D   D E L I R I U M  \nSimilarly, the prevention of anxiety, agitation and delirium begin with recognition. All combat casualties are at risk for \nanxiety, which they may attempt to conceal or not disclose. As with pain prevention, management of the underlying \netiology, including  pain, hypoxia, metabolic abnormalities, and medications effects are essential principals. Disorientation to \nplace and time as a result of unconsciousness, sedation, and loss of awareness resulting from hospitalization contribute to \nPAD. This can be preven ted with frequent and systemic efforts at reorientation and maintenance of normal sleep patterns.4 \nInterventions to promote healthy, REM sleep include exposure to bright light or sunlight during normal daytime hours and \nenforced darkness during normal nighttime  hours. Orders should be written for scheduled periods of minimal or no \ndisruption during normal sleep hours and allowing patients to use earplugs during sleep to minimize noise disruption. \nConversely, patients should be provided with hearing aids or eyeglasses , as needed, to combat sensory deprivation. Victims \nof close proximity blast exposure sho uld be presumed to have some degree of hearing loss and undergo an audiology \nevaluation. Intermittent dosing of analgesics and anxiolytics should be instituted prior to continuous dosing. Patients who \nrequire dosing more frequently than every 2 hours shoul d be placed on continuous dosing titrated to their goal.  \nEfforts to prevent delirium in critically injured patients include Awakening and Breathing Coordination (ABC), non -\npharmacologic Delirium (D) interventions, and early Exercise (E) and mobility. The ABCDEs should be incorporated into \ntreatment care plans fo r all intensive care unit  (ICU) patients starting no later than the Role 3.4,14  Propofol is an option for \nshort term sedation in acutely agitated patients. It has rapid onset and it is also cleared rapidly.  \nPropofol has been associated with hypotension which may be related to intravascular depletion. It is dissolved in a 10% lipid  \nsolution which should be accounted for when calculating calorie requirements. Propofol is an excellent drug for ICU patients \nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 scheduled to undergo Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) missions. When used for transport, Propofol should only be \nadministered to intubated patients.  \nSpontaneous Breathing Trials (SBT) should be performed daily. Physical and occupational therapy should be initiated as soon \nas possible or at minimum 72 hours after intubation.14,15 \nThere is insufficient evidence that prophylactic administration of antipsychotics to the general  ICU population prevents \ndelirium and, therefore, we make no recommendation for it.16  Benzodiazepines, although potentially useful for control of \nagitation, may increase delirium and should be avoided or minimized in patients experiencing or at increased risk for \ndelirium.  \nEVALUATION  OF  PAIN  \nSome level of pain is present in all combat casualties. While the pain may be initially masked by the intensity of the \nsituation, the combat medic or when the patient reaches the first level of care should assess the level of pain. Seriously \ninjured patien ts who are not intubated should be assessed every 1 -4 hours for the presence of pain. All patients who are \nintubated need to be continuously monitored for adequate analgesia. Signs of inadequate pain control in the intubated \npatient include tachycardia, hypertension,  and agitation. However – it is imperative that other causes be excluded such as \nearly compartment syndrome, missed injuries, or impending physiologic decline. If the patient is appropriately \ncommunicative, then using the DoD/VA Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) a nd Supplemental Questions as quantifiers can facilitate \nevaluation and trends.3,10  All combat casualties will have a pain score recorded on admission to a Level  III facility and as part \nof routine care while in the ICU. \nEVALUATION  OF  AGITATION  AND  DELIRIUM  \nThe assessment of anxiety, agitation, delirium as well as pain can be complicated by the presence of traumatic brain injury \n(TBI). TBI, in addition to overall injury burden, and therapeutic interventions can affect the evaluation for agitation as we ll as \nimpede an accurate neurologic assessment. Moderate to severe TBI patients are at particularly high risk for having atypical \nand/or paradoxical reactions to both sedating and stimulating agents.17,18  In addition, the reactions to individual agents and \ntheir  overall impact on the TBI patient in terms of pain, alertness, agitation, anxiety, and delirium may change drastically \nover relatively short periods of time as their injury and cognitive status evolves. The following tools help with pain \nevaluation: Richm ond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM); they are included as \nAppendi x D and Appendix E. \nTREATMENT  OF  PAIN:  GENERAL  INFO RMATIO N  \nAs previously stated,  pain is a universal symptom of the combat injured patient and must be managed early and effectively. \nAdequate early pain control has been shown to reduce post -traumatic stress disorder and ongoing pain control is an \nobligatory part of trauma care. Inadequ ate treatment results in undesirable consequences that delay or prevent a wounded \nwarrior’s full rehabilitation and recovery.  \nNon -pharmacologic pain therapies should be considered first -line treatment for mild to moderate pain or an adjunct to \nopioid medications. This includes battlefield acupuncture when administered by an appropriately qualified clinician and \nsupplies are available. (See Appendix F .) \nWith regards to specific opioid medications, any opioid available can be titrated to equal effectiveness for achieving desire d \npain control. This CPG is going to emphasize the use of Ketamine throughout the deployed continuum of care. Ketamine is a \nvery eff ective analgesic either by itself or as an adjunct to opioid analgesia and can be used to reduce the total narcotic \nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 burden.19,20  Ketamine, in parenteral doses of 0.15 -0.3 mg/kg, has been shown to reduce pain scores, total narcotic use, and \nneed for rescue medication when used with morphine for acute pain control.20 \nROLE  1  TREATMENT  OF  PAIN  \nThe Role I pain treatment guidelines described here are adopted directly from the most recent protocols developed by the \nDepartment of Defense’s Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC), available online at Deployed Medicine . \nCurrent guidelines, with full course material and supporting documentation,  are available through a Common Access Card \nenabled webpage from the Military Health System ( https://mhs.health.mil/References/REF_TCCC.cshtml  ). \nAdditionally, the Journal of the Special Operations Medical Association maintains free access to the current protocols \n(https://www.jsomonline.org/TCCC.html  ).21,22  See Appendix H  for a sample order set including medication options and \ndosing.  \nAnalgesia on the battlefield should generally be achieved using one of three options, per the TCCC triple analgesia protocol.  \nThis is an abbreviated presentation of that protocol. The detailed description can be obtained via websites described above.  \n▪ Option 1 , for mild to moderate pain when the casualty is still able to fight , should include the TCCC Combat pill \npack with acetaminophen and meloxicam given simultaneously.  \n▪ Option 2 , for mild to moderate pain when the casualty is not in shock or respiratory distress, and the casualty is not \nat significant risk of developing either condition, should include Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) 800 ug. \nNaloxone (0.4 mg IV or IM) should be available when using opioid analgesics.  \n▪ Option 3 , for moderate to severe pain when the casualty is in hemorrhagic shock or respiratory distress or the \ncasualty is at significant risk of developing either condition, should include ketamine 50 mg IM or IN or ketamine  \n20 mg slow IV or IO. Ketamine doses can be repeated every 30 minutes for IM or IN and every 20 minutes for IV or \nIO administration.  \nCasualties should be disarmed after being given OTFC and always disarmed after receiving ketamine. Documentation of a \nmental status exam using the Alert, Verbal, Pain, And Unresponsive (AVPU) method should be performed prior to and after \nadministering opioids or ketamine, and recorded on the TCCC Card (DD Form 1380, J un 2014). Ketamine may be a useful \nadjunct to reduce the amount of opioids required to provide effective pain relief. It is safe to give ketamine to a casualty \nwho has previously received morph ine or OTFC. IV Ketamine should be given over one minute.  \nROLE  2  TREATMENT  OF  PAIN  \nDamage Control Surgery is provided at Role 2. An anesthesiologist and/or certified registered nurse anesthetist who will be \non staff and in conjunction with the surgeons, will be responsible for perioperative pain management. Role 2s differ in the \ncapability with some consisting of a single operating room bed and a single post -operative ICU bed while others have \nattache d Emergency Care and Post -Operative Holding Capacity.  \nIn the more austere Role 2, pain should be managed with intravenous opioids and ketamine titrated as needed to provide \nadequate pain control; if dysphoric symptoms emerge with ketamine, then a small amount of benzodiazepine should be \nadministered.  \nMore robust Role 2s will have additional personnel, equipment, and supplies available. At these locations, the capability \nmight exist for peripheral nerve blocks, which could be performed by the anesthesia provider or by the orthopedic surgeon \nassigned to the unit. Infusion pumps may also be available for continuous opioid infusions in critically injured patients, with \ndosage titrated as needed to provide adequate pain control. Patients on infusions require close monitoring in an ICU setting.  \nSome of these more robust Role 2s with attached ward holding may have Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pumps that can \nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 be used by patients to manage their pain. Pain should be adequately controlled prior to starting PCA; the patient can then \nuse the PCA for self -dosing as needed for pain. The starting doses for PCAs are as follows:  \n▪ Morphine PCA in adults is 1 -3 mg with 10–20-minute  lockout . \n▪ Hydromophone PCA in adults is 0.1 -0.3 mg with 10–20-minute  lockout . \n▪ Fentanyl PCA is 15 -25 mcg with 10–20-minute  lockout.  \nPatients on PCA require monitoring by nursing staff. Naloxone must be available to treat respiratory distress that may occur \nsecondary to opioids.  \nROLE  3  TREATMENT  OF  PAIN  \nRegional anesthesia procedures should be performed in a monitored setting where nursing staff is available to help with \npatient care and provide appropriate recovery services for the patients. The APMS  (discussed extensively above) should \nmaintain and provide input for standing orders to include:  \n▪ Continuous epidural and peripheral nerve catheter infusion and single injection epidural or intrathecal narcotics.  \n▪ Intravenous PCA Orders. Fentanyl, hydromorphone, and morphine are the narcotic agents of choice. (Meperidine \n(Demerol) is not an approved compound for repeated PCA dosing as the metabolite normeperidine reduces the \nseizure threshold.)  \nLow dose ketamine infusions have profound analgesic effects with very minimal side effects. The anti - inflammatory effects \nof ketamine may also attenuate the systemic inflammatory response seen in trauma.13,23,24  Ketamine binds the N-methyl -D-\naspartate receptor and in addition to having direct analgesic properties, it also decreases the total dose of narcotics needed \nfor adjuvant pain control.  \nKetamine infusions should be made as follows:  \n▪ 250 mg of Ketamine in 250 ml of normal saline.  \n▪ For patients who are 70 kg or greater and less than 60 years old, start infusions at 10 mg per hour in the setting of \nacute and neuropathic pain.  \n▪ Patients > 60-year -old or <70kg should receive 100 micrograms/kg/hour of ketamine in the setting of acute or \nneuropathic pain.  \n▪ Custom orders may be titrated by the attending anesthesiologist or critical care physician.  \nEPID UR AL  CATHETERS  \nNeuraxial analgesia can be a very effective pain treatment in the injured warfighter, but special care must be taken to ensur e \nthat it is provided safely. Standard preservative free local anesthetics include ropivacaine and bupivacaine . The standard \nmedication for aeromedical evacuation is 0.2% ropivacaine with sufficient volume for 3 days. Patients should be on stable \ndoses of infusions prior to Aeromedical Evacuation ( AE) transportation. The risk/benefit of epidural placement must be \nconsidered in the inj ured combat casualty who is also at risk for venous thromboembolic events.  While all antiplatelet and \nanticoagulant medications increase the risk of bleeding, unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin \n(LMWH) use in patients undergoing epidural anesthesia greatly increases the risk of epidural hematoma, which can lead to \nparalysis. The APMS  should maintain and provide input for standing orders to include:  \n1 All catheters should receive a 3 ml test dose of local anesthetic containing at least 1:400,000 epinephrine.  \n2 LMWH and UFH use in patients undergoing epidural anesthesia increases the risk of spinal or epidural hematoma, \nwhich may cause long term or permanent paralysis. We recommend against the use of LMWH in AE patients given \nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9 the increased motion of delivery catheters during patient transport and resulting increased risk for spinal and \nepidural hematoma formation.  \n3 Before placement of an epidural  catheter:  \na. Prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 12 hours.  \nb. Low-dose prophylactic UFH should be held for 4 -6 hours.  \nc. Therapeutic LMWH should be held for at least 24 hours.  \nd. Therapeutic UFH should be held for at least 24 hours and the coagulation status assessed.  \n4 With an epidural catheter in place:  \na. The maximum recommended prophylactic dose of LMWH is 40mg SQ daily . \nb. The maximum recommended prophylactic dose of UFH is 5000U SQ TID . \nc. The initial dose of once daily prophylactic LMWH should not be given until 12 hours after catheter placement. \nSubsequent daily doses of prophylactic LMWH should start no sooner than 24 hours after the first dose.  \nd. The initial dose of low -dose prophylactic UFH can be given immediately after catheter placement . \ne. Twice daily dosing of prophylactic LMWH, therapeutic UFH, and therapeutic LMWH are not recommended.  \n5 Before epidural catheter removal:  \na. Prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 12 hours.  \nb. Low-dose prophylactic UFH should be held for 4 -6 hours.  \n6 After epidural catheter removal:  \na. Administration of prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 4 hours.  \nb. Administration of low -dose prophylactic UFH can occur immediately.  \nc. Administration of therapeutic LMWH should be held for at least 4 hours  \nd. Administration of therapeutic UFH should be held for 1 hour.  \nThese recommendations are consistent with the most recent ASRA (American Society of Regional Anesthesia) guidelines for \nthe prevention of epidural hematoma.2 \nNote : Given that our patients are transported through a spectrum of care and across thousands of miles, the \nimplementation of regional anesthesia should be integrated throughout the trauma system and must be safe and effective. \nAn anesthesia provider is respon sible for the initial placement and dosing of an epidural catheter. Only members of the \nAPMS can change the dosing or infusion rate.  \nAppendix G  is a summary of the ASRA  guidelines as they relate to use of LMWH in combat casualties. The ASRA guidelines \nwere originally developed for use of LMWH in the perioperative course.  \nAdditionally, these recommendations change on a frequent basis; https://www.asra.com/   should be consulted for the most \ncurrent recommendations.  \nPERIPH ERAL NERVE   CATHETERS  \n1 All catheters should undergo a local anesthetic test dose containing 1:400,000 epinephrine.  \n2 For patients undergoing deep plexus or deep peripheral block, we recommend that recommendations regarding \nneuraxial techniques be similarly applied.  For patients undergoing other plexus or peripheral techniques, we \nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  10 recommend management (performance, catheter maintenance, and catheter removal) based on site \ncompressibility, vascularity, and consequences of bleeding, should it occur.  \n3 Each patient should have no more than two catheters and the total dose of 0.2% Ropivacaine should not exceed 20 \nml per hour.  \n4 Regional anesthesia patients should be recovered by standard Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) criteria.  \nPatients with epidurals and peripheral nerve blocks should be held in recovery until they meet standard discharge criteria \nfrom PACU and ICU. Patients with peripheral nerve blocks and epidural catheters that have met discharge criteria from ICU \nand PACU ma y be managed on the floor. Any patient with an epidural catheter or peripheral nerve block must be closely \nmonitored for signs or symptoms of compartment syndrome (see below). No narcotics will be added to the peripheral nerve \nblock or epidural infusions g iven the ongoing revision of validation for air transport by the U.S. Air Force (USAF).  \nTREATMENT  OF  ANXIETY  AND  AGITATION  \nGiven the nature of combat injuries and the environment of care, both agitation and anxiety can be expected and should be \npreemptively managed. In a patient with normal hemodynamics, propofol is a good option for short -term sedation. \nPropofol does not provide analgesia; it is the most commonly used medication when sedation is required for ICU patients \nand CCAT transports due to its rapid onset and clearance. It is a gamma -aminobutyric acid  agonist with rapid onset and \nclearance. Propofol can cause hypotensi on and should be used with caution in patients with intravascular depletion. \nPropofol is dissolved in a 10% lipid solution. It is an excellent drug for ICU patients scheduled to undergo aeromedical \nevacuation. Propofol should only be administered to patien ts who have a definitive airway (endotracheal tube, \ntracheostomy), are hemodynamically stable and are continuously monitored by trained personnel.4,25,26 \nDexmedetomidine  is being used with increasing frequency in ICU patients and occasionally for transport. It minimally \ndecreases respiration, so it can be used for patients on non -invasive mechanical ventilation or sedation for an awake \nintubation. It has some mild analges ic effects. It should be used with caution in patients with bradycardia or heart block. \nDexmedetomidine is a relatively selective alpha -2 agonist; it is a good option for short -term sedation and anxiolysis. \nDexmedetomidine has minimal impact  on respiratory drive allows for ongoing assessment of the patient’s mental status.4 \nClonidine  is an effective drug for treating patients with anxiety and agitation; it is particularly effective for patients with \nhypertension associated with agitation.5,27  Clonidine acts as an alpha -2 adrenergic agonist and also has sedative properties \nthat do not result in respiratory suppression. It may also be used for mild sedation and analgesia.27 \nTREATMENT  OF  DELIRIUM  \nThe typical antipsychotic haloperidol (Haldol®) and the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine (Seroquel®) are commonly used for \nthe treatment of delirium. Quetiapine can also be used as an anxiolytic; it is particularly effective when used QHS PRN to \nhelp regu late sleep in a patient at risk for anxiety and delirium. Both of these drugs may be associated with prolongation of \nthe QT interval potentially resulting in fatal arrhythmias secondary to torsades des pointes. If these drugs are used, the QT c \ninterval sho uld be monitored with an electrocardiogram (EKG) on a daily basis. They should be discontinued if the QTc \nexceeds 500 msec or the interval increases 60 msec from baseline.4 \nPREVEN TING  COM PLIC ATIONS  \nMedications should be specifically directed and dosed to achieve a defined goal, for example:  \n▪ Achieve a pain score of 4 or less  \nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  11 ▪ Maintain sufficient patient consciousness to assess the evolution of injuries by physical exam  \n▪ Decrease the need for mechanical ventilation  \n▪ Amelioration of symptoms of anxiety, delirium,  or agitation  \nSEDATI ON  HOL IDAY  &  INTERMITTENT  MEDICATION  D OSING  \nI N T E R M I T T E N T   D O S I N G  \nIntermittent dosing of analgesics and anxiolytics, as opposed to continuous dosing, has been shown to reduce the duration \nof mechanical ventilation and intermittent dosing of analgesics and anxiolytics should be instituted prior to continuous \ndosing. Altho ugh many sedative agents are utilized for their short duration of action (e.g. midazolam), administration as a \ncontinuous infusion will often result in a prolonged duration of action and effect due to fat storage an accumulation of acti ve \nmetabolites. It i s recommended that intermitted sedation be used whenever feasible. For patients who require dosing more \nfrequently than every 1 -2 hours, continuous dosing titrated to effect can be used; however, continuous infusions should be \nconverted to intermittent dos ing as early as possible.  \nS E D AT I O N   VA C AT I O N S  \nDaily interruptions of sedation (“sedation vacations”) have repeatedly demonstrated reduction in the duration of \nmechanical ventilation as well as the incidence of ventilator -associated pneumonia.21  Intermittent dosing and daily sedation \nholidays prevent the accumulation of active metabolites, which may impede patient assessment for prolonged periods of \ntime.25,28 \n▪ Continuous infusions should be stopped daily to obtain a reliable physical examination, including neurologic \nassessment, and to perform a spontaneous breathing trial in ventilated patients.  \n▪ Sedation goals should be assessed every day following sedation holidays and every effort should be made to reduce \ninfusion doses.  \nC O N T R A I N D I C AT I O N S   T O   T H E   D A I LY   S E D AT I O N   H O L I D AY:  \n▪ Intractable intracranial hypertension.  \n▪ Hemodynamic instability.  \n▪ Inability to adequately oxygenate or ventilate mechanically ventilated patients.  \nSee Appendix H  for a sample order set including medication options and dosing.  \nSee Table 1 in Appendix A  for suggested management algorithms.  \nLO CAL  ANESTHETIC  TOXICITY  \nLocal anesthetic toxicity is extremely rare in a patient who has an established neuraxial or peripheral nerve catheter. If \nsuspected, all local anesthetic infusions should be immediately stopped. Occasionally the presenting symptom is cardiac \narrest. In ca rdiac arrest, the patient should immediately receive 1.5 ml/kg of 20% Intralipid while receiving chest \ncompressions and other ACLS interventions such as airway management. Repeat the bolus 1 -2 times as needed for \npersistent asystole, pulseless electrical activity,  or reemergence of hemodynamic insanity. Increase the infusion rate to 0.5 \nmL/kg/min if hemodynamic instability persists or recurs. Continue the infusion for at least 10 min after hemodynamic \nstability is restored; discontinue within 1 hour if possible.  \nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  12 Another rare symptom of local anesthetic toxicity is seizure. Once again, the infusion should be stopped, seizure should be \ntreated with an anti -seizure medication and the airway should be controlled if necessary. Much more common symptoms of \nlocal anesthe tic toxicity are tinnitus, anxiety, restlessness, dizziness,  and blurred vision; in the case of these symptoms, the \ninfusion should be stopped.  \n1000 ml of 20% Intralipid should accompany patients receiving local anesthetic infusions during transport in the AE system.  \nNAUSEA  \nNausea is a common side effect of both trauma and the medications used to treat pain, anxiety, and delirium. Consider \nprophylactic treatment whenever possible and treat immediately upon patient report of symptoms. If the patient has \nrecently undergone an e mergency general anesthetic or any type of abdominal surgery, then ensuring that they are not at \naspiration risk is important prior to medication. If there is a concern for gastric distention or any type of obstruction \n(functional or mechanical), then the patient should receive gastric decompression with an nasogastric  tube in additional to \npharmacologic management for nausea.  \nOndansetron is a safe antiemetic in the adult population and is increasingly the therapy of choice for acute undifferentiated  \nand trauma -related nausea.29  It has no effect on consciousness or the respiratory drive; additionally, at the doses \nrecommended for these patients (4 -8 mg per dose) has no clinically significant effect on QT interval.29-32 \nCOMPA RTMENT  SYNDROME  \nCompartment syndrome is a well -described complication of traumatic injury; for the purposes of this CPG, only extremity \ncompartment syndrome will be discussed. Definitive treatment is complete surgical release of the extremity compartments \naffected. The APMS consultant and trauma surgeon should h ave a detailed discussion regarding patients who are at high risk \nfor compartment syndrome. Pain control may mask the typical early sign of compartment syndrome: increased pain in the \ncompartment. Any patient at risk for extremity compartment syndrome who is awake and has an increased pain medication \nrequirement should be promptly and thoroughly assessed for increased compartment pressure. For patients with regional \nor neuraxial analgesia affecting an extremity that is felt to be at risk for compartment syn drome, more frequent clinical \nassessments and monitoring of the extremity are warranted. If the patient is unable to reliably detect and report pain and \nthere are any clinical or examination findings concerning for a compartment syndrome, then bedside asse ssment of \ncompartment pressures or performance of a fasciotomy should be done promptly. If there is any concern for compartment \nsyndrome, then full compartment release with fasciotomies must be completed prior to aeromedical transportation. Newer \nmonitorin g technologies such as near infrared spectroscopy; have shown some promise in early noninvasive detection of \ncompartment syndrome; however, they are not currently the standard of care.  \nAIR  EVACUATION  CONSIDER ATIONS  \nThe USAF Patient Movement Request must state the type of regional anesthesia being utilized. All individuals participating \nin the care of the patient should have up -to-date training and experience with regional anesthesia, techniques, medications, \nand equi pment. All equipment associated with the use of regional anesthesia must be approved for flight. The current \ninfusion pump system that has been approved by the USAF for air evacuation is the small portable Ambit pump. Ambit \npumps should be used for epidura l, peripheral nerve catheters, ketamine infusions, narcotic infusions, and patient \ncontrolled anesthesia. For all patients receiving regional anesthesia/analgesia, coordinate with the Trauma Chief, Theater \nValidating Flight Surgeon,  and Theater CCATT Director prior to any planned fixed -wing tactical (Intratheater) or strategic \n(Intertheater) transport to ensure patient safety during flight operations.  \nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  13 Patients undergoing prolonged air evacuation are exposed to a multitude of austere environments over a relatively short \nperiod of time. CCATT providers recognize that turbulence, weather, temperature, limited patient access and monitoring \nconstraints make it inherently difficult to maintain sedation and analgesia. It may be necessary to empirically increase \nsedation and pain regimens to maintain a safety margin that protects endotracheal tubes and other invasive devices. This \nclouds a patient’s neurologic e xam. Therefore patients with potential intracranial injury (TBI or stroke) who cannot be \nserially, neurologically evaluated should have intracranial pressure monitors.  \nIn terms of peripheral nerve blocks or epidural catheters, no narcotics will be added to the infusions; the addition of \nnarcotics to these regional therapies changes the validation for air transport by the USAF.  \nGUIDAN CE  \n▪ The Military Advanced Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia handbook is an excellent APMS reference text for pain \ncare standards ( https://medcoe.army.mil/borden -4-specialty -titles  ). \n▪ Tri-service policies for pain management can be found at https://www.dvcipm.org/  . \n▪ Strategic issues on evacuation pain management should be referred by the health care facility APMS consultant to \nthe Defense and Veterans Pain Management Initiative organization ( https://www.dvcipm.org/  ). \nPERF OR MANCE  IMPRO VEMENT  (PI)  MONITOR ING:  \nP O P U L AT I O N   O F   I N T E R E S T  \nAll injured patients  \nI N T E N T   ( E X P E C T E D   O U T C O M E S )  \n▪ Patients in the population of interest have a documented pain assessment at every role of care.  \n▪ Patients in the population of interest in the intensive care unit are screened for delirium daily.  \n▪ Intubated patients will not experience an inadvertent or unplanned extubation.  \nP E R F O R M A N C E   A D H E R E N C E   M E T R I C S  \n▪ Number and percentage of patients in the population of interest who have a documented pain assessment at each \nrole of care.  \n▪ Number and percentage of patients in the population of interest in the intensive care unit with documented \ndelirium screen daily.  \n▪ Number and percentage of intubated patients who experience an inadvertent or unplanned extubation.  \nD ATA   S O U R C E  \n▪ Patient Record  \n▪ Department of Defense Trauma Registry (DoDTR)  \nS Y S T E M   R E P O R T I N G   &   F R E Q U E N C Y  \nThe above constitutes the minimum criteria for PI monitoring of this CPG.

An exception  would  be physicians  without  formal  training but the requisite skills that easily \ntranslate to this procedure (i.e. surgeons, anesthesia, ER, critical care).  \nSupplies  Needed : 10 Auricular  Semi -Permanent  (ASP)  needles  and alcohol  pads.  \nPatients  should  NOT  receive  BFA if: \n▪ The patient  has an active  infection  in an ear that is going  to be used  for BFA (treat  only  uninfected  ear) \n▪ A bleeding  disorder  is present  (relative  contraindication)  \n▪ The patient  is pregnant  or might  be pregnant  \n▪ Current  or previous  keloid  scar formation  on either  ear \nSteps  to apply  BFA needles:  \nRead  ALL steps  before  proceeding.  \n1. Patient Education and Consent  – explain the procedure and expected course of having the ASP needle in place for \n2-4 days while continuing regular activities.  \n2. Cleanse area  – use alcohol swabs to disinfect both ears.  \n3. Place ASP needles  \na Begin by applying needle at lowest point shown in figure below (the Cingulate Gyrus). Start on the side with \nmost pain, then switch to the opposite side after body movements described in step b. Proceed to the next \npoint and continue alternating sides unti l pain is resolved (0 or 1 out of 10).  \nb After each needle application, the patient should walk 10 -20 steps unassisted or move their arms/legs for 30 -\n60 seconds if physically unable to walk unassisted.  \nc If adverse symptoms are noted during the procedure, remove the last needle placed unless doing so is too \nuncomfortable. Symptoms include lightheadedness, near -fainting, euphoria, or increasing pain level.  \n \n4.

Antiplatelet or oral anticoagulant medications administered in combination with LMWH increases the risk of spinal \nhematoma. ASRA recommends against concomitant administration of antiplatelet drugs, standard heparin, dextran \nor coumadin, regardless of LMWH dosing regimen.  \n2. Before placement of an epidural catheter:  \na Prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 12 hours.  \nb Therapeutic LMWH should be held for at least 24 hours.  \n3. With an epidural catheter in place:  \na The maximum recommended prophylactic dose of LMWH is 40mg SQ daily  \nb The initial dose of once daily prophylactic LMWH should not be given until 12 hours after catheter placement. \nSubsequent daily doses of prophylactic LMWH should start no sooner than 24 hours after the first dose.  \nc Twice daily dosing of prophylactic LMWH and therapeutic LMWH are not recommended.  \n4. Before epidural catheter removal:  \na Prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 12 hours.  \n5. After epidural catheter removal:  \na Administration of prophylactic LMWH should be held for at least 4 hours (and at least 12 hours after catheter \nplacement).  \nb Administration of therapeutic LMWH should be held for at least 4 hours (and at least 24 hours after catheter \nplacement).  \n6. Neuraxial anesthetic techniques should be avoided in patients who are receiving NSAIDS and LMWH.  \n7. For patients undergoing deep plexus or deep peripheral blocks , apply neuraxial recommendations   \n8. For patients undergoing other plexus or peripheral techniques, we recommend management (performance, \ncatheter maintenance, and catheter removal) based on site compressibility, vascularity, and consequences of \nbleeding, should it occur.  Twice daily prophylactic LMWH  is acceptable with these types of regional  nerve \ncatheters.  \n \n \n \nPain, Anxiety and Delirium  CPG ID: 29 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  24 APPEN D IX  H:  SEDATIO N  ORDERS  \nAllergies:  Weight:  kg \nDiagnosis:    \nService:  Attending:   \nSEDATION  ANALGESIA  DELIRUM  \nSee ICU Sedation  Analgesia  Delirium  Algorithm  \nNursing  Orders  \n Daily  sedation  hold \n1.

This applies to off -label uses with patients who \nare armed f orces members.   \nBACKGROUND  \nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of FDA -approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are usually \nnot subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved \ndrugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part \nof clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved \nuses may also be subject to speci al regulations.   \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS  \nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it does not \nimply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard \nof care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care \npractitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for t he \nclinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship.  \nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES  \nBalanced Discussion  \nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by the FDA. \nFurther, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that \nsugge st caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA -issued warnings.  \nQuality Assurance Monitoring  \nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring of \noutcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.  \nInformation to Patients  \nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an unusual off -\nlabel use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be given to including in an  \nappendix  an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product. \nInformation to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a \nDoD health care practitio ner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with \nsuch use.  \n \n",

However, drowning events in com bat and operational environments can occur and are highly influenced by the\ntactical environment. In civilians, drowning is thought to be preventable in over 90% of cases.1-2  As a result of the significant\nhuman, social, and economic tolls of drowning, th e World Health Assembly adopted their first resolution regarding\ndrowning prevention in 2023.3  The purpose of this  clinical practice guideline provides an overview of drowning and\nassociated conditions based on the best available current medical evidence. It should be used as a standardized framework\nto guide first responders, prehospital emergen cy medical service personnel, and medical department personnel  in\nevaluating, diagnosing, and managing common in -water emergencies. Caregivers supporting operatio ns with an increased\nrisk of drowning should review this CPG with the entire medical team including first responders.\nM I L I TA R Y   O C C U PAT I O N S   W I T H   D R O W N I N G   R I S K  A N D  E P I D E M I O L O G Y\nVarious military occupations involve significant water exposure and carry a risk of drowning. These include but are not\nlimited to naval operations at sea, military special operations, combat swimmers, divers, and amphibious assault units. Each\nunit has ri sk management measures in place to mitigate the risk of drowning events and subsequently provide immediate\naid.\nBetween 2013 and 2017, 359 recreational and line of duty drowning cases were identified amongst active -duty service\nmembers. Generally, members of the Marine Corps  are at highest risk as well as members working within motor\ntransport occupations. Off duty alcohol related incidents and alcohol use disorder continue to play a significant factor in\ndrowning risk.2,4\nCombat related drowning incidents have been associated with a mortality as high as 37.5% and are often related to\nvehicle roll overs. One 2 -year epidemiology study found that combat related drowning represents 3% of all combat\ndeaths.5-6\nMan -overboard events aboard naval vessels at sea are uncommon occurrences but are associated with a high mortality\nwhen they occur. Between 1970 and 2020 there were 220 man -overboard events on U.S. Naval subsurface and surface\nvessels involving 352 casualti es with an associated 72% mortality.7\nNaval vessel collisions at sea impacting the integrity of the ship’s hull can result in highly lethal drowning events. The\n2017 USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain collisions with separate large civilian commercial ships both resulted in\nsignificant hull  breaches below the waterline. In the two events, there were 85 reported casualties from the combined\nwarship crews, 20% (17) died from drowning .\nThe epidemiology of drowning incidents during amphibious vehicle training is unknown, but they do occur. In 2020 an\nAmphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) carrying 15 Marines and 1 Sailor took on water and sunk during a training exercise.\nUltimately 8 Marines an d 1 Sailor died from drowning. One severely injured Marine required ongoing critical care and\nrespiratory support.8\nC I V I L I A N   E P I D E M I O L O G Y   O F   D R O W N I N G\nReported incidence of 360,000 to over 500,000 civilian deaths attributed to unintentional drowning annually, not\nincluding boating accidents or those related to natural disasters. *These numbers are thought to be underreported.\n2, 9-10\nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5\nWorldwide, children ages 1 -4 have the highest rates of drowning, followed by children ages 5 -9. Boys are twice as likely\nto die from drowning.3\nIt is the leading cause of death or contributing factor among scuba divers (100 -150/year). Primary etiology of death can\nbe difficult to determine as distinction between equipment malfunction or medical emergency can be challenging.10-12\nPAT H O P H Y S I O L O G Y   O F   D R O W N I N G\nDrowning occurs when water fills the airways for any reason. It is important to note that progressive aspiration of water can\nresult in hypoxemia. If loss of consciousness occurs, the continued hypoxemia can result in bradycardia and cardiac arrest. I n\nthe lungs , aspiration can cause a washout and destruction of alveolar surfactant resulting in severe hypoxia, alveoli\nderecruitment, reduced pulmonary compliance and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, all of which can complicate\nventilator management. It should also be noted that there is no such thing as “Near Drowning.” Correct terminology\nincludes “Non -Fatal Drowning” and “Fatal Drowning.”\nImmersion in water when associated with panic, exhaustion, inadequate water competency, a medical emergency such as\nlethal cardiac dysrhythmia or seizure, or effects of hypo/hyperthermia can lead to drowning from one of the following\nmechanisms:10-15\n▪ Airway below the water’s surface  → breath hold breakpoint (inability to resist urge to breathe due to hypercapnia\nand hypoxemia) → progressive aspiration and subsequent hypoxemia (see below) → loss of consciousness (LOC) →\napnea and passive airway flooding → bradycardia → cardiac arrest.1\n▪ Aspiration (either sea water or fresh water) causes a degree of surfactant washout/destruction increased alveolar\nsurface tension and diminished integrity of the alveolar -capillary membrane atelectasis/ derecruitment and\ndisruption of the alveolar capillar y membrane → unregulated fluid shifts resulting in noncardiogenic pulmonary\nedema, reduced pulmonary compliance ( ~10 -40% with as little as 1 -3cc/kg water) →  right to left shunting\nresulting in hypoxemia . 1\n▪ Cold water submersion → inadvertent gasp for air (“cold shock response”) → tachypnea, vasoconstriction,\ntachycardia from sympathetic surge →arrhythmias (especially in patients with long QT syndrome) or\nparasympathetic mediated bradycardia (“diving response”), altered mental status, diminished strength, and\ncoordination.1   Table 1 shows expected survival times in cold water.\nTable 1.

Examples of prevention and operational risk management in high -risk military occupations include:\n▪ Sailors assigned to naval vessel are indoctrinated in the principles of universal damage control, which among other\ntenets includes techniques to control (e.g., shoring materials, secure hatches) or remove flooding water\n(e.g., pumps) when the hull is breeched. Hull integrity is typically controlled with shoring materials such as\nmattresses, pillows, canvas materials, hydraulic jacks and wooden wedges, beams, plugs or blocks.\n▪ Amphibious operations are a particularly high -risk activity as evidenced by a recent 2020 amphibious assault\nvehicle tragedy during a training event. Of issues that led to the nine drowning deaths, failure to apply appropriate\noperational safety protocols contributed, highlighting the importance of prevention .8  With this risk, all personnel\nassigned to these platforms are required to complete both intermediate level swim qualifications and submersible\nvehicle egress training. All personnel have received some degree of Tactical Combat Casualty Care training in or der\nto provide buddy aid in the event of an emergency. Training evolutions require the presence of Marine Corps\nInstructors of Water Survival who are trained for in -water rescue.\n▪ Implementation of risk management measures during dive and other high -risk water operational and training\nevolutions is critical in prevention of drowning. These measures include pre -evolution safety briefs, trained standby\nand safety divers, swim buddies,  on scene medical providers, water rescue crafts on site, wearing personal flotation\ndevice s, drilling  man -overboard procedures, and use of light sticks for night training.\n▪ Careful consideration must be given to the potential risks of conducting open sea operations in extreme\nenvironmental conditions such as rough sea state or heavy swell. In these extreme conditions, operations or\ntraining should be altered (when possible) t o mitigate the risk of drowning and other mishaps.\n▪ Divers should undergo thorough review of dive plan prior to scheduled dives to include anticipated depth/time\nprofile ensuring adequate air supply in addition to routine pre -dive equipment safety checks.\nP H A S E S   O F   T R E AT M E N T  1 1 , 1 5\n1. Initial resuscitation\n2. Advanced prehospital care\n3. Emergency Room (ER) / Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Care\nINITIAL  RESUSCITATION\n▪ Call for help and encourage patient to move away from danger.16-17\n▪ Place the patient so that the head and feet are at the same level. If rescuing a patient from the shoreline, place\nthem parallel to the shoreline.\n▪ Airway, Breathing, Circulation. If unconscious and not breathing, begin with 5 rescue breaths, then continue with\ntraditional basic life support utilizing a ratio of 30 compressions and 2 rescue breaths. Five breaths are used\ninitially as a recruitment man euver. Drowning patients without circulatory arrest will often respond to rescue\nbreaths alone.10\n▪ Ventilation support with available tools (oxygen, bag valve mask (BVM), etc .).\n▪ Rescue breaths and CPR represent significant risk of emesis in drowning victims (65% of those requiring rescue\nand 88% of those receiving chest compressions).10  Placing patients in the recovery position as able can reduce the\nrisk of subsequent aspiration.\nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 ▪ Prepare for transportation to a higher echelon of care. All victims of drowning who require resuscitation (including\nrescue breathing alone) should be transported to the hospital for evaluation and monitoring, even those who are\nalert and demonstrate hemod ynamic and respiratory stability at the scene of initial injury.\nADVANC ED  PREHOS PITAL  CARE\nPatients requiring continued resuscitation or those with concern for hypothermia may require more advanced prehospital\ncare which cannot be delivered by typical bystanders such as definitive airway management, supplemental oxygen or\nmechanical ventilatory support, gastric decompression, or thermal insulation.11,15 Aggressive resuscitation attempts should\nbe initiated unless clear signs of death or as limited by operational requirements. Patients have survived prolonged\nsubmersion historically, especially in  the hypothermic environment.13  For this level of care, use the typical ABCDE format\nbelow.\nA I R WAY\n▪ Assess patency of the patient's airway; consider foreign bodies unique to drowning injuries such as sand or\nseaweed and perform finger sweep if there is a visible obstruction.\n▪ If the patient is unconscious and unable to maintain their own airway, place the patient in the recovery position\n(lateral recumbent) to minimize risk of aspiration. 10-11\n▪ In the obtunded patient, consider early intubation if an expert in airway management is available. Definitive\nairway is required in patients with respiratory arrest as soon as feasible. Continued use of BVM will increase risk of\nemesis. If a unit is traine d for the capability, intubation will decrease risk of aspiration if it is available in the pre -\nhospital environment.\n▪ Due to concern for increased pulmonary airway pressures required for ventilation of the drowning patient, the use\nof supraglottic airways (e.g., laryngeal mask airways) is discouraged and maintaining a seal may be ineffective.10\nB R E AT H I N G\n▪ Immediately perform five rescue breaths in a patient who remains unconscious and in respiratory arrest.10,18\n▪ If the patient is breathing spontaneously, immediately apply O2 at 15 liters/min by nonrebreather as soon as\npossible and until discontinued by medical officer.10-11\n▪ Consider early use of positive pressure to maintain  PEEP .  Aspiration can reduce surfactant and increase atelectasis.\n▪ Avoid head down positioning or abdominal thrusts as they decrease ventilation and increase risk of vomiting,\nwhich can lead to aspiration. Heimlich maneuver is NO LONGER recommended for drowning.16,19\n▪ Goal oxygen saturation is 92 -96%: Place pulse oximeter on ear lobe or forehead for more accurate readings.20,21\nC I R C U L AT I O N\n▪ While pulses may be difficult to identify due to hypothermia or hypotension, absence of a pulse necessitates\ninitiation of Basic Life Support/Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocols. See Table 2  for CPR guidance in the\ndrowning patient.\n▪ Most common dysrhythmias are asystole and pulseless electrical activity. Defibrillation is not indicated with these\nrhythms. Attempts to attach an AED should not be made if it delays or interferes with compressions and\nventilation.10,11,13\n▪ Shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia) are present in <6% of patients and have a\nmore positive prognosis.1\nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 ▪ Obtain IV access when able. Intraosseous access is an acceptable alternative if unable to obtain IV access.\nAdministering ACLS  medications through the endotracheal tube is discouraged in the drowning patient.10,11\n▪ Many drowning patients will be volume depleted intravascularly and will have volume responsive hemodynamics.\nIn patients who are mechanically ventilated  or receiving positive pressure, hypotension may be more common as\nincreased intrathoracic pressure reduces central venous return/preload. IV crystalloid should be considered if\navailable. In the hypothermic patients, warmed IV fluids at 43°C (109°F) should be considered.16\n▪ Use of IV fluids must be judicious given the increased risk for noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in these patients.\n▪ Notably, many ACLS interventions, including pacing, atropine, lidocaine, and defibrillation, are ineffective with low\ncore body temperatures. Antiarrhythmics should be withheld for core temperatures of < 30 °C (86 °F).\n▪ Emphasis should be placed on chest compressions and ventilations to maintain perfusion.18\nD I S A B I L I T Y   ( N E U R O L O G I C )\n▪ Initial determination of Glasgow Coma Score should be completed to guide additional resuscitative efforts.\n▪ If circumstances surrounding the drowning are unwitnessed and loss of consciousness is persistent, consider other\netiologies other than hypoxemia, such as head injury, intoxication, arterial gas embolism (AGE). This will depend\non circumstances surrounding  the event (e.g., scuba diver surfacing unconscious or with neuro complaint) .12\n▪ If AGE is suspected, begin notification of hyperbaric chamber team (See Appendix B).\n▪ The following have not shown benefit in the unconscious drowning patient: hyperosmolar agents (e.g., mannitol\nor hypertonic saline), hyperventilation, barbiturate coma, intracranial pressure monitoring.\n▪ Glucose – maintain between 80 -140 mg/dL for ventilated patients .\nE N V I R O N M E N T   ( H Y P O T H E R M I A   M A N A G E M E N T )\n▪ Keep the victim warm (use core temperature instead of infrared devices - a low range refrigerator thermometer\nmay be necessary). Stabilize body temperature - dry and insulate the patient to prevent heat loss.11,21-22\n▪ Mild hypothermia:  34 -35°C (93.2 -95°F): passive rewarming (i.e. warm blankets and environment).\n▪ Moderate hypothermia: 30 -34°C (86 -93.2°F): active external rewarming will be required when available (i.e.\nheating blankets, radiant heat, forced hot air, warmed IV fluids at 43°C (109°F), warm water packs).\n▪ Severe hypothermia: < 30°C (86°F): active internal rewarming will be required when available (peritoneal lavage,\nesophageal rewarming tubes, cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal circulation); consider extracorporeal\nmembrane oxygenation. Withhold ACLS me dications until temperature >30°C (86°F).16\nD I S P O S I T I O N\n▪ Gastric decompression: Consider placement of an orogastric or nasogastric tube in the stabilized, intubated\npatient given the increased risk of emesis from resuscitative efforts.\n▪ Evacuation: Evacuate if victim required resuscitation, was unresponsive in the water, or has dyspnea or other\nrespiratory symptoms.\n▪ Continue resuscitation and transport to higher level of care unless there are obvious signs of death.\nT E R M I N AT I N G   R E S U S C I TAT I O N   E F F O R T S1 1 , 1 9\n▪ If the victim has been submerged for greater than 60 minutes, in -water rescue should transition to body recovery.\n▪ In the non -hypothermic patient, resuscitation may be stopped after 30 minutes of CPR without return of\nspontaneous circulation.\nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9 ▪ In the hypothermic patient, continue resuscitation until patient is rewarmed to 30 -34 °C/86 -93 °F, then continue\nCPR. Efforts may be discontinued if the patient remains asystolic for greater than 20 minutes. Lowest known\ndocumented initial temperature in p atient with full neurologic recovery was 56.6°F/13.7 °C.\n▪ Duration of submersion correlates with risk of death or severe neurologic impairment as noted:10\n 0-5 min – 10%\n 6-10 min – 56%\n 11-25 min – 88%\n >25 min – nearly 100%\nTable 2.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the Drowning Patie nt10\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the Drowning Patient\nCPR Recommendation\nWhen to initiate   Patient with respiratory distress or respiratory arrest\n Submerged for < 60 min with no obvious physical evidence of death (dismemberment,\nrigor mortis, decomposition, decapitation)\nContinue until   Signs of life reappear, rescuers are exhausted, advanced -life-support team takes over, or\nscene becomes unsafe for rescuer\nWhen to terminate   After 30 minutes of high -quality CPR without return of vital signs for a patient submerged\nin warm water (i.e. non -hypothermic)\n After hypothermic patient has been rewarmed to 30 -34 °C/86 -93 °F and asystole has\npersisted for >20 minutes for a patient submerged in cold water\nED / ICU CARE\nI N I T I A L   E R  A S S E S S M E N T   A N D   I N T E R V E N T I O N S\nUpon arrival to the Emergency Room (ER), rapidly evaluate the patient and rule\nout traumatic injury. Perform primary (ABCDE) and secondary assessment with\nspecific focus on the following: secure airway, provide adequate oxygenation,\nensure hemodynamic stab ility, gastric decompression, thermal insulation, and\nidentifying concomitant traumatic injury.   10,11,19,22  Following initial ER\nresuscitation, specific systems -based interventions may be applied as noted in the\nICU Management section. Additional immedia te interventions below (does not\nsubstitute for ER standards of care):\n▪ Chest X -Ray – regardless of patient’s clinical appearance.\nUsed to establish a baseline.\n▪ Electrocardiogram (EKG)\n▪ Volume resuscitation as appropriate for hemodynamic support. Urinary\ncatheter placement. Invasive monitoring (e.g., arterial line) and central\naccess at the discretion of the treating physician.\n▪ CT head and neck is recommended in the persistently unconscious\npatient to look for evidence of traumatic injury.

At\na minimum an ultrasoun d FAST (Focused Assessment Sonography for Trauma) should be performed in all drowning\nvictims without evidence of trauma. In unconscious patients, in addition to a CT head and neck, perform a pelvic X -\nray as pelvic fracture can be a significant source of b leeding.  In drowning victims with persistent hypotension\nwithout evidence of trauma, CT torso (chest, abdomen, and pelvis) should be performed to rule out solid organ\ninjury, retroperitoneal bleeding or other occult traumatic injury.\nE R   D I S P O S I T I O N\nOnce the patient is stabilized from a respiratory and hemodynamic standpoint, disposition should be determined. Figure 1\nbelow helps to establish guidelines for ICU admission versus observation and safe discharge based drowning mortality risk\nand drowning grade (Table 3).\nPatients with a Grade 2 or lower may safely be observed either in the ER or non -intensive care inpatient observation for\n4-6 hours.1\n▪ Patients are responsive to verbal and tactile stimuli (GCS >13).\n▪ May have cough or rales on pulmonary evaluation.\n▪ Able to maintain oxygenation with low -flow oxygen (typically 2L by nasal canula).\nPatients with Grades 3 -6 should be admitted to the ICU.1\n▪ Unresponsive patients\n▪ Patients with significant pulmonary edema or respiratory failure\n▪ Patients in shock (hypotension or poor perfusion shown by capillary refill, elevated lactate, organ failure)\nAppropriate consults should be made at this time and may include critical care (medical and neurological), cardiology,\npsychology.\nTable 3.

Early efforts should be made to\nimprove central nervous system oxygen delivery while providing\nevidence -based neuroprotection in the post -resuscitative\nperiod.\n▪ Maintain adequate oxygenation of SaO2 >92%. *In the\nintubated post arrest patient, hyperoxia (PaO2\n>300mmHg) is associated with poor neurologic\noutcomes.41 Consider placement of an arterial line to\nmonitor PaO2.\n▪ Maintain systemic mean arterial pressure > 65mmHg\nto ensure adequate cerebral perfusion (cerebral\nperfusion pressure = mean arterial pressure –\nintracranial pressure). Low dose vasopressor support\nmay be necessary. As discussed above, in military\ndrowning patients with an abnormal neurologic exam\nand persistent hypotension, ICU caregivers must rule\nout traumatic injury and hemorrhage as a cause of\nhypotension.\n* There is no evidence to support inv asive intracranial\npressure monitoring or supranormal cerebr al perfusion\npressures.23\n▪ Maintain head of bed at 30 degrees with head midline.\n▪ Only aggressive fever prevention is recommended.\nCooling with targeted temperature management is\nNOT recommended.24\nIn patients who are still rewarming, aggressive shivering control\nshould be implemented (See Figure  2 on right for an example of\nshivering management protocol). Significant adverse effects\nfrom prolonged shivering include lactic acidosis, elevated\nintracranial pressure, rhabdomyolysis, discomfort, and\ninterference with monitoring devices.24\nP U L M O N A R Y\nAspiration of both seawater and freshwater in relatively small\nquantities can lead to disruptions in the surfactant equilibrium\nof the lungs. Reduced surfactant leads to atelectasis which can\nmake patients more prone to atelectrauma and subsequent biotrauma (neutrophil migration and subsequent acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome or sepsis).36,38  Osmotic shifts in the alveoli can lead to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema\nwhich results in reduced compliance, right to left shunting, and hypoxemia. Evidence -based care for mechanically ventilated\npatients should be followed. 2\n▪ Maintain saturation at 92% (or PaO2 between 55 -80mmhg) while avoiding hyperoxia.  Figure 2.  Example Shivering Management Protocol\nTargeted temperature management involves careful\nmonitoring of temperature with an invasive\ntemperature probe, targeting a safe temperature, and\ncoordinated multimodal control of shivering.

Current literature suggests achieving a PaO2>FIO2 ratio of >250.\n▪ Once adequate oxygenation has been achieved, the same PEEP\nshould be maintained for 48 hours without attempts to wean\nfrom the ventilator.\n▪ The best available evidence indicates pulmonary surfactant\nrestores in 48 hours. Early attempts at extubation may lead to\nrecurrent pulmonary edema and increased ventilator days.\n▪ Avoid permissive hypercapnia (unless neurologic status is\nintact) due to concern for concomitant neurologic injury that\nmay worsen with high pCO2.\n▪ A lung protective ventilator strategy should be followed with\nthe goal of preventing barotrauma.\n Maintain tidal volumes of 6cc/kg of predicted body weight.\n PEEP strategy as noted above.\n Maintain plateau pressures < 30 cmH20, Driving pressure <15 cmH20.\n Consider bronchoscopy for quantitative cultures and foreign body removal if there is concern for aspiration\n(e.g., sand, seaweed).\n Patients with prolonged, severe, or refractory hypoxemia should be considered for ECMO; however, drowning\npatients were not specifically included in landmark ECMO trials (e.g., EOLIA, CESAR). Case reports of ECMO use\nin profoundly hypothermic patients have  demonstrated some success.\n▪ No role for artificial surfactant.\nC A R D I O VA S C U L A R\nLow output heart failure and lethal dysrhythmias are common in drowning victims. While hypoxemia is the primary driver of\nthese conditions, correction of hypoxemia may not immediately restore normal cardiac function and ICU physicians should\nbe prepared to  manage these issues. Reduced cardiac output may lead to cardiogenic component of pulmonary edema or\nworsen additional organ failure (e.g., cardiorenal syndrome).1\n▪ Consider echocardiogram initially. In patients requiring inotropic support, consider cardiac output monitoring\nthrough either noninvasive cardiac output monitoring, pulse contour analysis, or pulmonary artery catheter.\n▪ Maintain MAP goal of >65mmHg. Stroke volume variation can be utilized to identify patients that may be volume\nresponsive and should be given additional crystalloid resuscitation. Judicious fluid resuscitation should be\nmaintained.\n▪ Patients who are not volume responsive and remain hypotensive should receive vasopressor support. Again, be\nsure to rule out traumatic injury and hemorrhage as a cause of hypotension.\n▪ Patients should remain on continuous telemetry to assess for dysrhythmias.\n▪ EKG or telemetry may demonstrate the presence of Osborne waves or J Waves (extra deflection at the end of the\nQRS complex) in the hypothermic patient. See Figure  3 below.\nOnce adequate oxygenation has been\nachieved, the same PEEP should be\nmaintained for 48 hours without\nattempts to wean from the ventilator.\nThe best available evidence indicates\npulmonary surfactant restores in 48\nhours. Early attempts at extubation\nmay lead to recurrent pulmonary\nedema and increased ventilator days.\nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  14\nH E M AT O L O G I C ,  E N D O C R I N E ,  A N D  R E N A L\nDrowning victims requiring the ICU are critically ill and can be prone to the same hematologic, metabolic, and renal\npathologies as other ICU patients. There is no evidence that there is clinically significant hemolysis or electrolyte shifts in\ndrowning pa tients. Rates of renal failure secondary to decreased perfusion during resuscitative efforts or subsequent\ndecreased cardiac output are similar to other cardiac arrest patients.\n▪ No role for routine use of bicarbonate in patients with metabolic acidosis .10\n▪ Maintain euglycemia (140 -180mg/dl) .25\n▪ Renal failure in the majority of drowning patients is uncommon ; however, when present, it may be secondary to\ndecreased perfusion, myoglobinuria or hemoglobinuria.10\nI N F E C T I O U S  D I S E A S E\nThere is no role for prophylactic antibiotics in drowning victims either in freshwater or saltwater. Furthermore, rates of\nantimicrobial resistance in bacteria obtained from seawater drowning victims is negligible and broad -spectrum coverage is\nnot indicat ed.\n▪ Broad spectrum antibiotics to cover both gram -positive and gram -negative bacteria are indicated in patients where\ndrowning occurs in a source with a high pathogen load (UFC >10).20\n▪ Monitor patient for signs and symptoms of pneumonia (new pulmonary infiltrates on imaging, leukocytosis, fever,\nworsened respiratory status).\n▪ Routine cultures are not required unless specific concern is present.\n▪ Consider bronchoscopy for quantitative cultures or source control of possible aspirated nidus of infection.\nSWIMMI NG INDUCED PULM ON ARY EDEMA (SI PE)\nMost commonly presents in individuals conducting sustained strenuous surface swimming in cold water (e.g., Marine\ncombat swimmers, special operators, scuba divers, and triathletes).26,27  Studies have shown a variable incidence of SIPE\namong different populations. Symptom severity can range from full recovery within 24 hours to death.28-33  While severe\noutcomes are possible, most otherwise healthy individuals will recover within 24 -48 hours. Recurrence of SIPE is not\nuncommon.34\nFigure 3.

A general timeline is provided for guidance below with expected survival times\nlisted in Table 1  at the beginning of CPG .\n▪ Control breathing in order to survive shock of exposure during the initial one minute.\n▪ Within 10 minutes, exposed individuals will become incapacitated and thus must move judiciously during this time.\nIf able to reach and maintain control of the ice, the victim should hold on to the edge of the ice, kick his/her feet to\nbecome horizontal and  pull. See ice rescue training images  (Figure 4) .\n▪ Incapacitated individuals will generally become unresponsive due to hypothermia within the first hour.\n▪ Onset of lethal dysrhythmia can occur within the first 2 hours.\n▪ If a flotation device is available, exposed individuals should assume the “ HELP ” position (heat escape lessening\nposture)  (Figure 5.)  by bringing the knees to the chest and crossing the arms over them. Alternatively, in a group,\nthe \" huddle ” position  (Figure 5.)  should be used.1-2\nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  20 Figure 4. Ice rescue training\nRESCUE AND IN -WATER RESUSCITATION\n**Please note this is placed  as an appendix based on standard international recommendations. This does not take the place\nof standard unit military training.**\n▪ Identify and locate the victim (ask if there are more than one).1-2\n▪ Victims are often seen motionless, sinking slightly below the surface.\n▪ They may submerge into the water and never surface.\nGOALS\n▪ Initially the type of water does NOT matter (salt, fresh, clean, dirty).1-2\n▪ Alert advanced life support as soon as possible.\n▪ Accurately record environmental conditions including time of submersion, type and temperature of water and air,\nscuba diver (depth, time at depth, type of dive rig).\n▪ As a clinical provider, if you find yourself being a rescuer, don’t become a victim. If you are being deployed on a\nNaval vessel – ensure you have taken all the courses about rescue swimming. Rescuer safety is a priority. Untrained\nrescuers or weaker swimm ers should utilize alternative means of rescue such as the use of flotation devices, ropes,\nor paddles. Options for rescue include but are not limited to the following: 1-2,10\n1. Reach with an object from the safety of the shore or ship.\n2. Throw an object like a rope or flotation devices (this may help the victim stay afloat or the search and rescue\nteam locate the victim.)\n3. Row (or paddle) a smaller craft to the victim if they are too far from shore to reach or have a floatation device\nthrown.  The rescuer should ideally stay out of the water.\n4. Tow them into shore or away from danger in the water (i.e. swift water rescue).\n5. Go into the water (as a last resort) to rescue the victim if this is within the rescuer’s skill set.\n▪ In water rescue, breaths should only be done when rapid extraction is NOT feasible. In water, chest compressions\nare NOT effective and should not be attempted. 1,11,12,16,\n▪ Cervical spine injury in drowning victims is low (0.009%). Unnecessary cervical spine immobilization can impede\ndelivery of rescue breaths via time of application and reduced airway opening. Routine stabilization of the cervical\nspine in the absence of cir cumstances that suggest a spinal injury (diving, boat accident, and fall from height) is not\nrecommended. If suspected, protect cervical spine by assuming neck injury (use jaw thrust to open the airway and\nutilize C -Collar when feasible).1-3,9,17\n1. Hold onto the edge of the ice.  2. Kick feet to get  horizontal\nand pull.  3. Slide or roll away from the hole.\nDO NOT STAND .\nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  21 ▪ Hypothermic patients rescued from cold water are prone to lethal dysrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation). Patients\nshould be handled as gently as possible to include the performance of life saving procedures (e.g., intubation s) as\nthese may precipitate dysrhythmias. Priority remains oxygenation, ventilation, and restoring circulation. 13\nFigure 5.  HELP and Huddle positions 14\nPhoto by Sgt.

Immersion : “some portion of the body is covered in water” (i.e. head is out of the water) .\n2. Submersion : “during submersion, the entire body, including the airway, is under water” (i.e. head is in the water) .\n3. Submersion injuries : “water -related conditions that do not involve the airway and respiratory systems .\n4. Drowning : “the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid.”  The\ndrowning process begins with respiratory impairment as the person’s airway goes below the surface of the liquid\n(submersion) or water splashes over the face wh ile being completely in a liquid (immersion).1-3\nSubdivided into 3 categories:\n▪ Fatal drowning: “person dies at any time as a result of submersion/immersion with respiratory impairment.”\n▪ Non -fatal drowning with morbidity: “person is injured at any time as a result of submersion/immersion with\nrespiratory impairment but survives.”\n▪ Non -fatal drowning without morbidity: “person survives uninjured from submersion/immersion event with\nrespiratory impairment but survives.”\n5. Water rescue : “submersion or immersion incident without evidence of respiratory impairment.”1-4\n6. Shallow water blackout : “hyperventilating to decrease hypercapnic drive to breathe and prolong ability to stay\nunder water such that hypoxemia results in unconsciousness.”  The compulsion to breathe from hypercapnia\n(acidosis) is physiologically more potent than hypoxemia (exce pt when subverted by hyperventilation –\ni.e. lowering CO2).5\n7. Asphyxia : “a condition where breathing stops and both hypoxia and hypercapnia occur simultaneously due to:\n(1) the absence of gas to breathe; (2) the airway being completely obstructed; (3) respiratory muscles being\nparalyzed; or (4) respiratory center failing to send impulses to  breathe.”  Running out of compressed air is a\ncommon cause of asphyxia in SCUBA d iving.1,5,6\n8. Drowning after shallow water diving : Diving into shallow water makes concussion, head injury, and cervical spine\n(C-spine)  injury more common, so rescuer must balance C -spine precautions against time of extraction (normally in\ndrowning C -spine precautions are not required because the risk is < 0.5%).   Also consider drug/alcohol\nimpairment.1,6\n9. Warm water drowning : Unplanned submersion  → panic and violent struggle  → gulping / swallowing of air and\nwater →  breath holding until hypoxia leads to unconsciousness  → gag reflex relaxing resulting in passive influx of\nwater  → drowning if PFD does not keep airway out of the water.1\n10. Cold water drowning:  Impacts every organ system similar to complex trauma. Sudden immersion in cold water\n( < 91.4°F/33 °C) causes panic, reflexive gasp for air and rapid breathing making:1-5, 8-10\n▪ Inhalation/aspiration of water is more likely.\n▪ Core temperature drop causing arrhythmias, confusion, incapacitation (diminished strength and coordination)\nincreasing the chance of drowning.\n▪ Water conduct heat away from the body 25 times faster than air leading to immersion hypothermia – impaired\nmeaningful movement usually precedes.1,6,8\nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  25 TERMS NOT TO USE\nTerms NOT to use as they do not have diagnostic or therapeutic distinctions (although still widely used by medical\nprofessionals and the lay public, so important to be familiar with them).1,4,5,7,8,11\n1. Wet drowning: “Fluid is aspirated into the lungs.” Aspiration of water occurs in only 80 -90% of cases and does not\nchange the treatment or management.\n2. Dry drowning: “Fluid is not aspirated; death is due to laryngospasm and glottis closure.”  Asphyxia still occurs\nsecondary to laryngospasm occurring in 10 -20% of cases, but no change in management.  Difference is only\nrelevant at autopsy.\n3. Secondary drowning/Delayed onset of respiratory distress: Varied definitions with death occurring from 1 -72 hours\nafter initial resuscitation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Fifteen percent of victims conscious at\ninitial resuscitation s ubsequently die from ARDS.\n4. Near drowning: “Suffocation by submersion in a liquid with at least temporary survival.  Death from near drowning\noccurs after 24 hours.”  Caused confusion because it had 20 different published definitions, most commonly if the\nperson is rescued at any tim e, thus interrupting the process of drowning.\n5. Immersion syndrome: “Sudden death immediately following submersion in very cold water” thought to be caused\nby vagal nerve stimulation resulting in overwhelming bradycardia.\n6. Active drowning: Witnessed drowning .\n7. Passive drowning: Unwitnessed drowning .\n8. Fresh water vs. saltwater drowning: Typical human aspiration during drowning is 4 mL/kg.  To change blood volume\nrequires 8mL/kg, or to alter electrolytes require 22 mL/kg.  Therefore, not clinically significant, and instead focus\nremains on hypoxemia, aci dosis, and pulmonary injury rather than electrolyte or volume status.\n▪ Freshwater: Hypervolemia (in animal models only, not humans, so no clinical relevance) .\n▪ Saltwater: Hypovolemia with hypernatremia (in animal models only, not humans, so no clinical relevance) .\nREFERENCES\n1.

This applies to off -label uses with patients who\nare armed f orces members.\nBACKGROUND\nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of FDA -approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are usually\nnot subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved\ndrugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part\nof clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved\nuses may also be subject to speci al regulations.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS\nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it does not\nimply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard\nof care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care\npractitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for t he\nclinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship.\nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES\nBalanced Discussion\nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by the FDA.\nFurther, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that\nsugge st caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA -issued warnings.\nQuality Assurance Monitoring\nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring of\noutcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.\nInformation to Patients\nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an unusual off -\nlabel use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be given to including in an\nappendix an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product.\nInformation to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a\nDoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with\nsuch use."

However, drowning events in com bat and operational environments can occur and are highly influenced by the \ntactical environment. In civilians, drowning is thought to be preventable in over 90% of cases.1-2  As a result of the significant \nhuman, social, and economic tolls of drowning, th e World Health Assembly adopted their first resolution regarding \ndrowning prevention in 2023.3  The purpose of this  clinical practice guideline provides an overview of drowning and \nassociated conditions based on the best available current medical evidence. It should be used as a standardized framework \nto guide first responders, prehospital emergen cy medical service personnel, and medical department personnel  in \nevaluating, diagnosing, and managing common in -water emergencies. Caregivers supporting operatio ns with an increased \nrisk of drowning should review this CPG with the entire medical team including first responders.  \nM I L I TA R Y   O C C U PAT I O N S   W I T H   D R O W N I N G   R I S K  A N D  E P I D E M I O L O G Y  \nVarious military occupations involve significant water exposure and carry a risk of drowning. These include but are not \nlimited to naval operations at sea, military special operations, combat swimmers, divers, and amphibious assault units. Each \nunit has ri sk management measures in place to mitigate the risk of drowning events and subsequently provide immediate \naid. \nBetween 2013 and 2017, 359 recreational and line of duty drowning cases were identified amongst active -duty service \nmembers. Generally, members of the Marine Corps  are at highest risk as well as members working within motor \ntransport occupations. Off duty alcohol related incidents and alcohol use disorder continue to play a significant factor in \ndrowning risk.2,4  \n \nCombat related drowning incidents have been associated with a mortality as high as 37.5% and are often related to \nvehicle roll overs. One 2 -year epidemiology study found that combat related drowning represents 3% of all combat \ndeaths.5-6   \n \nMan -overboard events aboard naval vessels at sea are uncommon occurrences but are associated with a high mortality \nwhen they occur. Between 1970 and 2020 there were 220 man -overboard events on U.S. Naval subsurface and surface \nvessels involving 352 casualti es with an associated 72% mortality.7  \n \nNaval vessel collisions at sea impacting the integrity of the ship’s hull can result in highly lethal drowning events. The \n2017 USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain collisions with separate large civilian commercial ships both resulted in \nsignificant hull  breaches below the waterline. In the two events, there were 85 reported casualties from the combined \nwarship crews, 20% (17) died from drowning . \n \nThe epidemiology of drowning incidents during amphibious vehicle training is unknown, but they do occur. In 2020 an \nAmphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) carrying 15 Marines and 1 Sailor took on water and sunk during a training exercise. \nUltimately 8 Marines an d 1 Sailor died from drowning. One severely injured Marine required ongoing critical care and \nrespiratory support.8  \nC I V I L I A N   E P I D E M I O L O G Y   O F   D R O W N I N G  \nReported incidence of 360,000 to over 500,000 civilian deaths attributed to unintentional drowning annually, not \nincluding boating accidents or those related to natural disasters. *These numbers are thought to be underreported.   \n2, 9-10  \nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5  \nWorldwide, children ages 1 -4 have the highest rates of drowning, followed by children ages 5 -9. Boys are twice as likely \nto die from drowning.3  \n \nIt is the leading cause of death or contributing factor among scuba divers (100 -150/year). Primary etiology of death can \nbe difficult to determine as distinction between equipment malfunction or medical emergency can be challenging.10-12  \nPAT H O P H Y S I O L O G Y   O F   D R O W N I N G  \nDrowning occurs when water fills the airways for any reason. It is important to note that progressive aspiration of water can  \nresult in hypoxemia. If loss of consciousness occurs, the continued hypoxemia can result in bradycardia and cardiac arrest. I n \nthe lungs , aspiration can cause a washout and destruction of alveolar surfactant resulting in severe hypoxia, alveoli \nderecruitment, reduced pulmonary compliance and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, all of which can complicate \nventilator management. It should also be noted that there is no such thing as “Near Drowning.” Correct terminology \nincludes “Non -Fatal Drowning” and “Fatal Drowning.”  \nImmersion in water when associated with panic, exhaustion, inadequate water competency, a medical emergency such as \nlethal cardiac dysrhythmia or seizure, or effects of hypo/hyperthermia can lead to drowning from one of the following \nmechanisms:10-15   \n▪ Airway below the water’s surface  → breath hold breakpoint (inability to resist urge to breathe due to hypercapnia \nand hypoxemia) → progressive aspiration and subsequent hypoxemia (see below) → loss of consciousness (LOC) → \napnea and passive airway flooding → bradycardia → cardiac arrest.1  \n▪ Aspiration (either sea water or fresh water) causes a degree of surfactant washout/destruction increased alveolar \nsurface tension and diminished integrity of the alveolar -capillary membrane atelectasis/ derecruitment and \ndisruption of the alveolar capillar y membrane → unregulated fluid shifts resulting in noncardiogenic pulmonary \nedema, reduced pulmonary compliance ( ~10 -40% with as little as 1 -3cc/kg water) →  right to left shunting \nresulting in hypoxemia . 1  \n▪ Cold water submersion → inadvertent gasp for air (“cold shock response”) → tachypnea, vasoconstriction, \ntachycardia from sympathetic surge →arrhythmias (especially in patients with long QT syndrome) or \nparasympathetic mediated bradycardia (“diving response”), altered mental status, diminished strength, and \ncoordination.1   Table 1 shows expected survival times in cold water.  \nTable 1.

Examples of prevention and operational risk management in high -risk military occupations include:  \n▪ Sailors assigned to naval vessel are indoctrinated in the principles of universal damage control, which among other \ntenets includes techniques to control (e.g., shoring materials, secure hatches) or remove flooding water  \n(e.g., pumps) when the hull is breeched. Hull integrity is typically controlled with shoring materials such as \nmattresses, pillows, canvas materials, hydraulic jacks and wooden wedges, beams, plugs or blocks.  \n▪ Amphibious operations are a particularly high -risk activity as evidenced by a recent 2020 amphibious assault \nvehicle tragedy during a training event. Of issues that led to the nine drowning deaths, failure to apply appropriate \noperational safety protocols contributed, highlighting the importance of prevention .8  With this risk, all personnel \nassigned to these platforms are required to complete both intermediate level swim qualifications and submersible \nvehicle egress training. All personnel have received some degree of Tactical Combat Casualty Care training in or der \nto provide buddy aid in the event of an emergency. Training evolutions require the presence of Marine Corps \nInstructors of Water Survival who are trained for in -water rescue.  \n▪ Implementation of risk management measures during dive and other high -risk water operational and training \nevolutions is critical in prevention of drowning. These measures include pre -evolution safety briefs, trained standby \nand safety divers, swim buddies,  on scene medical providers, water rescue crafts on site, wearing personal flotation \ndevice s, drilling  man -overboard procedures, and use of light sticks for night training.  \n▪ Careful consideration must be given to the potential risks of conducting open sea operations in extreme \nenvironmental conditions such as rough sea state or heavy swell. In these extreme conditions, operations or \ntraining should be altered (when possible) t o mitigate the risk of drowning and other mishaps.  \n▪ Divers should undergo thorough review of dive plan prior to scheduled dives to include anticipated depth/time \nprofile ensuring adequate air supply in addition to routine pre -dive equipment safety checks.  \nP H A S E S   O F   T R E AT M E N T  1 1 , 1 5  \n1. Initial resuscitation  \n2. Advanced prehospital care  \n3. Emergency Room (ER) / Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Care  \nINITIAL  RESUSCITATION  \n▪ Call for help and encourage patient to move away from danger.16-17  \n▪ Place the patient so that the head and feet are at the same level. If rescuing a patient from the shoreline, place \nthem parallel to the shoreline.  \n▪ Airway, Breathing, Circulation. If unconscious and not breathing, begin with 5 rescue breaths, then continue with \ntraditional basic life support utilizing a ratio of 30 compressions and 2 rescue breaths. Five breaths are used \ninitially as a recruitment man euver. Drowning patients without circulatory arrest will often respond to rescue \nbreaths alone.10  \n▪ Ventilation support with available tools (oxygen, bag valve mask (BVM), etc .). \n▪ Rescue breaths and CPR represent significant risk of emesis in drowning victims (65% of those requiring rescue \nand 88% of those receiving chest compressions).10  Placing patients in the recovery position as able can reduce the \nrisk of subsequent aspiration.   \nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 ▪ Prepare for transportation to a higher echelon of care. All victims of drowning who require resuscitation (including \nrescue breathing alone) should be transported to the hospital for evaluation and monitoring, even those who are \nalert and demonstrate hemod ynamic and respiratory stability at the scene of initial injury.   \nADVANC ED  PREHOS PITAL  CARE  \nPatients requiring continued resuscitation or those with concern for hypothermia may require more advanced prehospital \ncare which cannot be delivered by typical bystanders such as definitive airway management, supplemental oxygen or \nmechanical ventilatory support, gastric decompression, or thermal insulation.11,15 Aggressive resuscitation attempts should \nbe initiated unless clear signs of death or as limited by operational requirements. Patients have survived prolonged \nsubmersion historically, especially in  the hypothermic environment.13  For this level of care, use the typical ABCDE format \nbelow.  \nA I R WAY   \n▪ Assess patency of the patient's airway; consider foreign bodies unique to drowning injuries such as sand or \nseaweed and perform finger sweep if there is a visible obstruction.  \n▪ If the patient is unconscious and unable to maintain their own airway, place the patient in the recovery position \n(lateral recumbent) to minimize risk of aspiration. 10-11  \n▪ In the obtunded patient, consider early intubation if an expert in airway management is available. Definitive \nairway is required in patients with respiratory arrest as soon as feasible. Continued use of BVM will increase risk of \nemesis. If a unit is traine d for the capability, intubation will decrease risk of aspiration if it is available in the pre -\nhospital environment.  \n▪ Due to concern for increased pulmonary airway pressures required for ventilation of the drowning patient, the use \nof supraglottic airways (e.g., laryngeal mask airways) is discouraged and maintaining a seal may be ineffective.10  \nB R E AT H I N G  \n▪ Immediately perform five rescue breaths in a patient who remains unconscious and in respiratory arrest.10,18  \n▪ If the patient is breathing spontaneously, immediately apply O2 at 15 liters/min by nonrebreather as soon as \npossible and until discontinued by medical officer.10-11  \n▪ Consider early use of positive pressure to maintain  PEEP .  Aspiration can reduce surfactant and increase atelectasis.  \n▪ Avoid head down positioning or abdominal thrusts as they decrease ventilation and increase risk of vomiting, \nwhich can lead to aspiration. Heimlich maneuver is NO LONGER recommended for drowning.16,19  \n▪ Goal oxygen saturation is 92 -96%: Place pulse oximeter on ear lobe or forehead for more accurate readings.20,21  \nC I R C U L AT I O N   \n▪ While pulses may be difficult to identify due to hypothermia or hypotension, absence of a pulse necessitates \ninitiation of Basic Life Support/Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocols. See Table 2  for CPR guidance in the \ndrowning patient.  \n▪ Most common dysrhythmias are asystole and pulseless electrical activity. Defibrillation is not indicated with these \nrhythms. Attempts to attach an AED should not be made if it delays or interferes with compressions and \nventilation.10,11,13      \n▪ Shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia) are present in <6% of patients and have a \nmore positive prognosis.1  \nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 ▪ Obtain IV access when able. Intraosseous access is an acceptable alternative if unable to obtain IV access. \nAdministering ACLS  medications through the endotracheal tube is discouraged in the drowning patient.10,11  \n▪ Many drowning patients will be volume depleted intravascularly and will have volume responsive hemodynamics. \nIn patients who are mechanically ventilated  or receiving positive pressure, hypotension may be more common as \nincreased intrathoracic pressure reduces central venous return/preload. IV crystalloid should be considered if \navailable. In the hypothermic patients, warmed IV fluids at 43°C (109°F) should be considered.16  \n▪ Use of IV fluids must be judicious given the increased risk for noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in these patients.  \n▪ Notably, many ACLS interventions, including pacing, atropine, lidocaine, and defibrillation, are ineffective with low \ncore body temperatures. Antiarrhythmics should be withheld for core temperatures of < 30 °C (86 °F).  \n▪ Emphasis should be placed on chest compressions and ventilations to maintain perfusion.18  \nD I S A B I L I T Y   ( N E U R O L O G I C )  \n▪ Initial determination of Glasgow Coma Score should be completed to guide additional resuscitative efforts.  \n▪ If circumstances surrounding the drowning are unwitnessed and loss of consciousness is persistent, consider other \netiologies other than hypoxemia, such as head injury, intoxication, arterial gas embolism (AGE). This will depend \non circumstances surrounding  the event (e.g., scuba diver surfacing unconscious or with neuro complaint) .12  \n▪ If AGE is suspected, begin notification of hyperbaric chamber team (See Appendix B). \n▪ The following have not shown benefit in the unconscious drowning patient: hyperosmolar agents (e.g., mannitol \nor hypertonic saline), hyperventilation, barbiturate coma, intracranial pressure monitoring.  \n▪ Glucose – maintain between 80 -140 mg/dL for ventilated patients . \nE N V I R O N M E N T   ( H Y P O T H E R M I A   M A N A G E M E N T )   \n▪ Keep the victim warm (use core temperature instead of infrared devices - a low range refrigerator thermometer \nmay be necessary).

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the Drowning Patie nt10  \nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the Drowning Patient  \nCPR Recommendation  \nWhen to initiate   Patient with respiratory distress or respiratory arrest  \n Submerged for < 60 min with no obvious physical evidence of death (dismemberment, \nrigor mortis, decomposition, decapitation)  \nContinue until   Signs of life reappear, rescuers are exhausted, advanced -life-support team takes over, or \nscene becomes unsafe for rescuer  \nWhen to terminate   After 30 minutes of high -quality CPR without return of vital signs for a patient submerged \nin warm water (i.e. non -hypothermic)  \n After hypothermic patient has been rewarmed to 30 -34 °C/86 -93 °F and asystole has \npersisted for >20 minutes for a patient submerged in cold water  \nED / ICU CARE  \nI N I T I A L   E R  A S S E S S M E N T   A N D   I N T E R V E N T I O N S  \nUpon arrival to the Emergency Room (ER), rapidly evaluate the patient and rule \nout traumatic injury. Perform primary (ABCDE) and secondary assessment with \nspecific focus on the following: secure airway, provide adequate oxygenation, \nensure hemodynamic stab ility, gastric decompression, thermal insulation, and \nidentifying concomitant traumatic injury.   10,11,19,22  Following initial ER \nresuscitation, specific systems -based interventions may be applied as noted in the \nICU Management section. Additional immedia te interventions below (does not \nsubstitute for ER standards of care):  \n▪ Chest X -Ray – regardless of patient’s clinical appearance.  \nUsed to establish a baseline.  \n▪ Electrocardiogram (EKG)  \n▪ Volume resuscitation as appropriate for hemodynamic support. Urinary \ncatheter placement. Invasive monitoring (e.g., arterial line) and central \naccess at the discretion of the treating physician.  \n▪ CT head and neck is recommended in the persistently unconscious \npatient to look for evidence of traumatic injury.

At \na minimum an ultrasoun d FAST (Focused Assessment Sonography for Trauma) should be performed in all drowning \nvictims without evidence of trauma. In unconscious patients, in addition to a CT head and neck, perform a pelvic X -\nray as pelvic fracture can be a significant source of b leeding.  In drowning victims with persistent hypotension \nwithout evidence of trauma, CT torso (chest, abdomen, and pelvis) should be performed to rule out solid organ \ninjury, retroperitoneal bleeding or other occult traumatic injury.  \nE R   D I S P O S I T I O N  \nOnce the patient is stabilized from a respiratory and hemodynamic standpoint, disposition should be determined. Figure 1  \nbelow helps to establish guidelines for ICU admission versus observation and safe discharge based drowning mortality risk \nand drowning grade (Table 3).  \nPatients with a Grade 2 or lower may safely be observed either in the ER or non -intensive care inpatient observation for \n4-6 hours.1  \n▪ Patients are responsive to verbal and tactile stimuli (GCS >13).  \n▪ May have cough or rales on pulmonary evaluation.  \n▪ Able to maintain oxygenation with low -flow oxygen (typically 2L by nasal canula).  \nPatients with Grades 3 -6 should be admitted to the ICU.1  \n▪ Unresponsive patients  \n▪ Patients with significant pulmonary edema or respiratory failure  \n▪ Patients in shock (hypotension or poor perfusion shown by capillary refill, elevated lactate, organ failure)  \nAppropriate consults should be made at this time and may include critical care (medical and neurological), cardiology, \npsychology.  \nTable 3.

Drowning Disposition and Treatment  \nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  12 ICU  MANAGEM ENT  \nN E U R O L O G I C  \nThe majority of long term sequalae of drowning events are \nsecondary to neurologic injury. Early efforts should be made to \nimprove central nervous system oxygen delivery while providing \nevidence -based neuroprotection in the post -resuscitative \nperiod.  \n▪ Maintain adequate oxygenation of SaO2 >92%. *In the \nintubated post arrest patient, hyperoxia (PaO2 \n>300mmHg) is associated with poor neurologic \noutcomes.41 Consider placement of an arterial line to \nmonitor PaO2.  \n▪ Maintain systemic mean arterial pressure > 65mmHg \nto ensure adequate cerebral perfusion (cerebral \nperfusion pressure = mean arterial pressure – \nintracranial pressure). Low dose vasopressor support  \nmay be necessary. As discussed above, in military \ndrowning patients with an abnormal neurologic exam \nand persistent hypotension, ICU caregivers must rule \nout traumatic injury and hemorrhage as a cause of \nhypotension.  \n* There is no evidence to support inv asive intracranial \npressure monitoring or supranormal cerebr al perfusion \npressures.23  \n▪ Maintain head of bed at 30 degrees with head midline.  \n▪ Only aggressive fever prevention is recommended. \nCooling with targeted temperature management is \nNOT recommended.24  \nIn patients who are still rewarming, aggressive shivering control \nshould be implemented (See Figure  2 on right for an example of \nshivering management protocol). Significant adverse effects \nfrom prolonged shivering include lactic acidosis, elevated \nintracranial pressure, rhabdomyolysis, discomfort, and \ninterference with monitoring devices.24  \nP U L M O N A R Y  \nAspiration of both seawater and freshwater in relatively small \nquantities can lead to disruptions in the surfactant equilibrium \nof the lungs. Reduced surfactant leads to atelectasis which can \nmake patients more prone to atelectrauma and subsequent biotrauma (neutrophil migration and subsequent acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome or sepsis).36,38  Osmotic shifts in the alveoli can lead to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema \nwhich results in reduced compliance, right to left shunting, and hypoxemia. Evidence -based care for mechanically ventilated \npatients should be followed. 2 \n▪ Maintain saturation at 92% (or PaO2 between 55 -80mmhg) while avoiding hyperoxia.  Figure 2.  Example Shivering Management Protocol  \n \nTargeted temperature management involves careful \nmonitoring of temperature with an invasive \ntemperature probe, targeting a safe temperature, and \ncoordinated multimodal control of shivering. It is always \npreferrable to prevent fever and shivering, if possib le.  \nSource: The Internet Book of Critical Care.  \n\nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  13 ▪ Oxygenation should be maintained by titrating fraction of inspired O2 (FIO2) and incremental increases in PEEP , \nwhich will help to reduce incidence of barotrauma. Current literature suggests achieving a PaO2>FIO2 ratio of >250.  \n▪ Once adequate oxygenation has been achieved, the same PEEP \nshould be maintained for 48 hours without attempts to wean \nfrom the ventilator.  \n▪ The best available evidence indicates pulmonary surfactant \nrestores in 48 hours. Early attempts at extubation may lead to \nrecurrent pulmonary edema and increased ventilator days.  \n▪ Avoid permissive hypercapnia (unless neurologic status is \nintact) due to concern for concomitant neurologic injury that \nmay worsen with high pCO2.    \n▪ A lung protective ventilator strategy should be followed with \nthe goal of preventing barotrauma.  \n Maintain tidal volumes of 6cc/kg of predicted body weight.  \n PEEP strategy as noted above.  \n Maintain plateau pressures < 30 cmH20, Driving pressure <15 cmH20.  \n Consider bronchoscopy for quantitative cultures and foreign body removal if there is concern for aspiration  \n(e.g., sand, seaweed).  \n Patients with prolonged, severe, or refractory hypoxemia should be considered for ECMO; however, drowning \npatients were not specifically included in landmark ECMO trials (e.g., EOLIA, CESAR). Case reports of ECMO use \nin profoundly hypothermic patients have  demonstrated some success.  \n▪ No role for artificial surfactant.  \nC A R D I O VA S C U L A R   \nLow output heart failure and lethal dysrhythmias are common in drowning victims. While hypoxemia is the primary driver of \nthese conditions, correction of hypoxemia may not immediately restore normal cardiac function and ICU physicians should \nbe prepared to  manage these issues. Reduced cardiac output may lead to cardiogenic component of pulmonary edema or \nworsen additional organ failure (e.g., cardiorenal syndrome).1  \n▪ Consider echocardiogram initially. In patients requiring inotropic support, consider cardiac output monitoring \nthrough either noninvasive cardiac output monitoring, pulse contour analysis, or pulmonary artery catheter.  \n▪ Maintain MAP goal of >65mmHg. Stroke volume variation can be utilized to identify patients that may be volume \nresponsive and should be given additional crystalloid resuscitation. Judicious fluid resuscitation should be \nmaintained.  \n▪ Patients who are not volume responsive and remain hypotensive should receive vasopressor support. Again, be \nsure to rule out traumatic injury and hemorrhage as a cause of hypotension.  \n▪ Patients should remain on continuous telemetry to assess for dysrhythmias.  \n▪ EKG or telemetry may demonstrate the presence of Osborne waves or J Waves (extra deflection at the end of the \nQRS complex) in the hypothermic patient. See Figure  3 below.  \n \n \n \n Once adequate oxygenation has been \nachieved, the same PEEP should be \nmaintained for 48 hours without \nattempts to wean from the ventilator.  \nThe best available evidence indicates \npulmonary surfactant restores in 48 \nhours. Early attempts at extubation \nmay lead to recurrent pulmonary \nedema and increased ventilator days.  \nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  14  \n \nH E M AT O L O G I C ,  E N D O C R I N E ,  A N D  R E N A L  \nDrowning victims requiring the ICU are critically ill and can be prone to the same hematologic, metabolic, and renal \npathologies as other ICU patients. There is no evidence that there is clinically significant hemolysis or electrolyte shifts in \ndrowning pa tients. Rates of renal failure secondary to decreased perfusion during resuscitative efforts or subsequent \ndecreased cardiac output are similar to other cardiac arrest patients.  \n▪ No role for routine use of bicarbonate in patients with metabolic acidosis .10  \n▪ Maintain euglycemia (140 -180mg/dl) .25  \n▪ Renal failure in the majority of drowning patients is uncommon ; however, when present, it may be secondary to \ndecreased perfusion, myoglobinuria or hemoglobinuria.10  \nI N F E C T I O U S  D I S E A S E  \nThere is no role for prophylactic antibiotics in drowning victims either in freshwater or saltwater. Furthermore, rates of \nantimicrobial resistance in bacteria obtained from seawater drowning victims is negligible and broad -spectrum coverage is \nnot indicat ed.  \n▪ Broad spectrum antibiotics to cover both gram -positive and gram -negative bacteria are indicated in patients where \ndrowning occurs in a source with a high pathogen load (UFC >10).20  \n▪ Monitor patient for signs and symptoms of pneumonia (new pulmonary infiltrates on imaging, leukocytosis, fever, \nworsened respiratory status).  \n▪ Routine cultures are not required unless specific concern is present.  \n▪ Consider bronchoscopy for quantitative cultures or source control of possible aspirated nidus of infection.  \nSWIMMI NG INDUCED PULM ON ARY EDEMA (SI PE)  \nMost commonly presents in individuals conducting sustained strenuous surface swimming in cold water (e.g., Marine \ncombat swimmers, special operators, scuba divers, and triathletes).26,27  Studies have shown a variable incidence of SIPE \namong different populations. Symptom severity can range from full recovery within 24 hours to death.28-33  While severe \noutcomes are possible, most otherwise healthy individuals will recover within 24 -48 hours. Recurrence of SIPE is not \nuncommon.34  \n \nFigure 3.

This engorges central veins and leads to an increase in cardiac preload and \npulmonary artery pressures. Inc reased pressure in the pulmonary vessels results in ‘fracturing’ of pulmonary \ncapillaries that lead to interstitial and alveolar edema.  \n▪ Diastolic dysfunction and stroke volume mismatch between the left and right ventricles may contribute to SIPE \npathophysiology. 38  \nM an agemen t :  \n▪ Typically, self -limiting and resolves with rest within 24 -48 hours.39  \n▪ Diuretics ,→ ,  2-agonists, and  supplemental oxygen may be given for persistent SIPE -related symptoms or severe \ncases of SIPE.40  \n▪ CPAP and PEP device have proved feasible and safe for pre -hospital treatment of SIPE. 39  \n \n \n \nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  16 PERF OR MANCE IMPR OV EMENT (PI)  M ONITOR ING  \nP O P U L AT I O N  O F  I N T E R E S T  \nDrowning casualties.  \nI N T E N T   ( E X P E C T E D   O U T C O M E S )  \n▪ Transport all drowning victims requiring rescue breathing or resuscitation to the hospital for evaluation and \nmonitoring.  \n▪ Intubate obtunded drowning victims early and avoid supraglottic airways.  \n▪ Avoid maneuvers that increase risk of emesis (e.g.., Heimlich, head -down, abdominal thrusts).  \n▪ Withhold antiarrhythmic medications in severe hypothermia with core temps < 30 °C (86 °F).  \n▪ Alert hyperbaric chamber teams in cases of suspected arterial gas embolism.  \n▪ Avoid osmotic diuresis, barbiturate coma, hyperventilation, and ICP monitoring.  \n▪ Institute active external rewarming for moderate hypothermia and active internal rewarming for severe \nhypothermia.  \n▪ Avoid shivering during rewarming measures .

A general timeline is provided for guidance below with expected survival times \nlisted in Table 1  at the beginning of CPG . \n▪ Control breathing in order to survive shock of exposure during the initial one minute.   \n▪ Within 10 minutes, exposed individuals will become incapacitated and thus must move judiciously during this time. \nIf able to reach and maintain control of the ice, the victim should hold on to the edge of the ice, kick his/her feet to \nbecome horizontal and  pull. See ice rescue training images  (Figure 4) .  \n▪ Incapacitated individuals will generally become unresponsive due to hypothermia within the first hour.  \n▪ Onset of lethal dysrhythmia can occur within the first 2 hours.  \n▪ If a flotation device is available, exposed individuals should assume the “ HELP ” position (heat escape lessening \nposture)  (Figure 5.)  by bringing the knees to the chest and crossing the arms over them. Alternatively, in a group, \nthe \" huddle ” position  (Figure 5.)  should be used.1-2 \n \nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  20 Figure 4. Ice rescue training  \n \n \nRESCUE AND IN -WATER RESUSCITATION  \n**Please note this is placed  as an appendix based on standard international recommendations. This does not take the place \nof standard unit military training.**  \n▪ Identify and locate the victim (ask if there are more than one).1-2 \n▪ Victims are often seen motionless, sinking slightly below the surface.  \n▪ They may submerge into the water and never surface.  \nGOALS  \n▪ Initially the type of water does NOT matter (salt, fresh, clean, dirty).1-2 \n▪ Alert advanced life support as soon as possible.  \n▪ Accurately record environmental conditions including time of submersion, type and temperature of water and air, \nscuba diver (depth, time at depth, type of dive rig). \n▪ As a clinical provider, if you find yourself being a rescuer, don’t become a victim. If you are being deployed on a \nNaval vessel – ensure you have taken all the courses about rescue swimming. Rescuer safety is a priority. Untrained \nrescuers or weaker swimm ers should utilize alternative means of rescue such as the use of flotation devices, ropes, \nor paddles. Options for rescue include but are not limited to the following: 1-2,10 \n1. Reach with an object from the safety of the shore or ship.  \n2. Throw an object like a rope or flotation devices (this may help the victim stay afloat or the search and rescue \nteam locate the victim.)  \n3. Row (or paddle) a smaller craft to the victim if they are too far from shore to reach or have a floatation device \nthrown.  The rescuer should ideally stay out of the water.  \n4. Tow them into shore or away from danger in the water (i.e. swift water rescue).  \n5. Go into the water (as a last resort) to rescue the victim if this is within the rescuer’s skill set.  \n▪ In water rescue, breaths should only be done when rapid extraction is NOT feasible. In water, chest compressions \nare NOT effective and should not be attempted. 1,11,12,16, \n▪ Cervical spine injury in drowning victims is low (0.009%). Unnecessary cervical spine immobilization can impede \ndelivery of rescue breaths via time of application and reduced airway opening. Routine stabilization of the cervical \nspine in the absence of cir cumstances that suggest a spinal injury (diving, boat accident, and fall from height) is not \nrecommended. If suspected, protect cervical spine by assuming neck injury (use jaw thrust to open the airway and \nutilize C -Collar when feasible).1-3,9,17 \n1. Hold onto the edge of the ice.  2. Kick feet to get  horizontal  \nand pull.  3. Slide or roll away from the hole.  \nDO NOT STAND . \nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  21 ▪ Hypothermic patients rescued from cold water are prone to lethal dysrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation). Patients \nshould be handled as gently as possible to include the performance of life saving procedures (e.g., intubation s) as \nthese may precipitate dysrhythmias. Priority remains oxygenation, ventilation, and restoring circulation. 13   \nFigure 5.  HELP and Huddle positions 14 \n \nPhoto by Sgt.

However, \noccasionally, diving units are unable to transport these recompression chamber systems and must \nutilize a non -Navy certified chamb er in proximity to diving operations. Military diving units should \nfollow unit policies and procedures. Chapter 6 of the Navy Dive Manual includes information on \ndetermining the level of chamber needed for a given dive profile.

Immersion : “some portion of the body is covered in water” (i.e. head is out of the water) . \n2. Submersion : “during submersion, the entire body, including the airway, is under water” (i.e. head is in the water) . \n3. Submersion injuries : “water -related conditions that do not involve the airway and respiratory systems . \n4. Drowning : “the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid.”  The \ndrowning process begins with respiratory impairment as the person’s airway goes below the surface of the liquid \n(submersion) or water splashes over the face wh ile being completely in a liquid (immersion).1-3   \nSubdivided into 3 categories:  \n▪ Fatal drowning: “person dies at any time as a result of submersion/immersion with respiratory impairment.”  \n▪ Non -fatal drowning with morbidity: “person is injured at any time as a result of submersion/immersion with \nrespiratory impairment but survives.”  \n▪ Non -fatal drowning without morbidity: “person survives uninjured from submersion/immersion event with \nrespiratory impairment but survives.”  \n5. Water rescue : “submersion or immersion incident without evidence of respiratory impairment.”1-4  \n6. Shallow water blackout : “hyperventilating to decrease hypercapnic drive to breathe and prolong ability to stay \nunder water such that hypoxemia results in unconsciousness.”  The compulsion to breathe from hypercapnia \n(acidosis) is physiologically more potent than hypoxemia (exce pt when subverted by hyperventilation –  \ni.e. lowering CO2).5 \n7. Asphyxia : “a condition where breathing stops and both hypoxia and hypercapnia occur simultaneously due to:  \n(1) the absence of gas to breathe; (2) the airway being completely obstructed; (3) respiratory muscles being \nparalyzed; or (4) respiratory center failing to send impulses to  breathe.”  Running out of compressed air is a \ncommon cause of asphyxia in SCUBA d iving.1,5,6  \n8. Drowning after shallow water diving : Diving into shallow water makes concussion, head injury, and cervical spine \n(C-spine)  injury more common, so rescuer must balance C -spine precautions against time of extraction (normally in \ndrowning C -spine precautions are not required because the risk is < 0.5%).   Also consider drug/alcohol \nimpairment.1,6  \n9. Warm water drowning : Unplanned submersion  → panic and violent struggle  → gulping / swallowing of air and \nwater →  breath holding until hypoxia leads to unconsciousness  → gag reflex relaxing resulting in passive influx of \nwater  → drowning if PFD does not keep airway out of the water.1   \n10. Cold water drowning:  Impacts every organ system similar to complex trauma. Sudden immersion in cold water  \n( < 91.4°F/33 °C) causes panic, reflexive gasp for air and rapid breathing making:1-5, 8-10  \n▪ Inhalation/aspiration of water is more likely.  \n▪ Core temperature drop causing arrhythmias, confusion, incapacitation (diminished strength and coordination) \nincreasing the chance of drowning.  \n▪ Water conduct heat away from the body 25 times faster than air leading to immersion hypothermia – impaired \nmeaningful movement usually precedes.1,6,8 \n \n \nDrowning Management  CPG ID: 64 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  25 TERMS NOT TO USE  \nTerms NOT to use as they do not have diagnostic or therapeutic distinctions (although still widely used by medical \nprofessionals and the lay public, so important to be familiar with them).1,4,5,7,8,11 \n1. Wet drowning: “Fluid is aspirated into the lungs.” Aspiration of water occurs in only 80 -90% of cases and does not \nchange the treatment or management.  \n2. Dry drowning: “Fluid is not aspirated; death is due to laryngospasm and glottis closure.”  Asphyxia still occurs \nsecondary to laryngospasm occurring in 10 -20% of cases, but no change in management.  Difference is only \nrelevant at autopsy.  \n3. Secondary drowning/Delayed onset of respiratory distress: Varied definitions with death occurring from 1 -72 hours \nafter initial resuscitation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Fifteen percent of victims conscious at \ninitial resuscitation s ubsequently die from ARDS.  \n4. Near drowning: “Suffocation by submersion in a liquid with at least temporary survival.  Death from near drowning \noccurs after 24 hours.”  Caused confusion because it had 20 different published definitions, most commonly if the \nperson is rescued at any tim e, thus interrupting the process of drowning.  \n5. Immersion syndrome: “Sudden death immediately following submersion in very cold water” thought to be caused \nby vagal nerve stimulation resulting in overwhelming bradycardia.  \n6. Active drowning: Witnessed drowning . \n7. Passive drowning: Unwitnessed drowning .  \n8. Fresh water vs. saltwater drowning: Typical human aspiration during drowning is 4 mL/kg.  To change blood volume \nrequires 8mL/kg, or to alter electrolytes require 22 mL/kg.  Therefore, not clinically significant, and instead focus \nremains on hypoxemia, aci dosis, and pulmonary injury rather than electrolyte or volume status.  \n▪ Freshwater: Hypervolemia (in animal models only, not humans, so no clinical relevance) . \n▪ Saltwater: Hypovolemia with hypernatremia (in animal models only, not humans, so no clinical relevance) . \nREFERENCES  \n1.

This applies to off -label uses with patients who \nare armed f orces members.   \nBACKGROUND  \nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of FDA -approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are usually \nnot subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved \ndrugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part \nof clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved \nuses may also be subject to speci al regulations.   \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS  \nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it does not \nimply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard \nof care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care \npractitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for t he \nclinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship.  \nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES  \nBalanced Discussion  \nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by the FDA. \nFurther, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that \nsugge st caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA -issued warnings.  \nQuality Assurance Monitoring  \nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring of \noutcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.  \nInformation to Patients  \nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an unusual off -\nlabel use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be given to including in an \nappendix an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product. \nInformation to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a \nDoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with \nsuch use.  \n \n",

Thus, airway management is often a critical early step in the\nresuscitation of the severely injured trauma patient. Identifying harbingers of a potentially difficult airway,\nhaving knowledge of a difficult airway algorithm, and understanding the proper utilization of alternative airway\ndevices will allow for a pre -planned strategy for successful airway management.\nSIGNIFICANT  CHANGES\nRefer to  in Appendix A  for Trauma Airway Assessment guidance and Appendix B  for Difficult Airway\nManagement.\n1. Ketamine is the first line agent for R apid Sequence Intubation  (RSI) .\n2. Apply principles of Apnei c Oxygenation.\n3. Utilize device name rather than brand -name wherever possible.\n4. Eliminate blind nasal intubation.  Anticipate fiber optic guidance if available.\n5. Use waveform or digital capnography as primary tool to verify tube placement if available.\n6. Remove recommendation for use of an intubating L aryngeal Mask Airway .\n7. Offer surgical cricothyroidotomy or tracheostomy as surgical airway options.\n8. Optimize RSI and Intubation Pathway for all patients.  Separate Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI ) algor ithm\nnot required.\n9. Include specific pediatric recommendations.\n10. Trauma airway management should be rehearsed with your trauma team on a regular basis to include role assignments and familiarization with difficult airway management and surgical airway equipm ent.\nPERFORMANCE  IMPROVEMENT   (PI)  MONITORING\nPOPULATION  OF  INTEREST\n All patients who received ETT/cricothyroidotomy/ supraglottic  airway/NPA\n All patients with compromised airway (initial GCS < 8 or AIS head and neck ≥ 3 or AIS face ≥ 3,\narrival/transport or initial ED SpO2 < 90%, arrival/transport or initial ED ETCO2 > 50).\nINTENT   (EXPECTED   OUTCOMES)\n All injured patients who present with obtundation (GCS<8), apnea, respiratory distress or insufficiency,\nairway obstruction, or impending airway loss will have a secure and definitive airway established\nexpeditiously upon arrival to a Role 2 or Role 3.\n SpO2 is maintained between ≥ 90% and 96%.

This applies to off -label\nuses with patients who are armed forces members.\nBACKGROUND\nUnapproved (i.e., “off -label”) uses of FDA -approved products are extremely common in American medicine and\nare usually not subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances,\nunapproved uses of approved drugs are subject  to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These\ncircumstances include such uses as part of clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved uses may also be subject to spec ial regulations.\nADDITIONAL   INFORMATION  REGARDING   OFF -LABEL  USES   IN  CPGS\nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further,\nit does not imply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard of care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of\nthe responsible health care practitioner by providing information regardi ng potential risks and benefits of\ntreatment alternatives. The decision is for the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner\nwithin the practitioner -patient relationship.\nADDITIONAL   PROCEDURES\nBalanced  Discussion\nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved\nby the FDA. Further, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data,\nincluding any such data that suggest caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA -issued\nwarnings.\nQuality  Assurance   Monitoring\nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance\nmonitoring of outcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.\nInformation  to  Patients\nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an unusual off -label use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be\ngiven to including in an appendix an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before\nor after use of the product. Information to patients should addres s in plain language: a) that the use is not\napproved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a DoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this\npurpose; and c) the potential risks associated with such use."

Thus, airway management is often a critical early step in the \nresuscitation of the severely injured trauma patient. Identifying harbingers of a potentially difficult airway, \nhaving knowledge of a difficult airway algorithm, and understanding the proper utilization of alternative airway \ndevices will allow for a pre -planned strategy for successful airway management.  \nSIGNIFICANT  CHANGES  \nRefer to  in Appendix A  for Trauma Airway Assessment guidance and Appendix B  for Difficult Airway \nManagement. \n1. Ketamine is the first line agent for R apid Sequence Intubation  (RSI) . \n2. Apply principles of Apnei c Oxygenation.  \n3. Utilize device name rather than brand -name wherever possible.  \n4. Eliminate blind nasal intubation.  Anticipate fiber optic guidance if available.  \n5. Use waveform or digital capnography as primary tool to verify tube placement if available.  \n6. Remove recommendation for use of an intubating L aryngeal Mask Airway . \n7. Offer surgical cricothyroidotomy or tracheostomy as surgical airway options.  \n8. Optimize RSI and Intubation Pathway for all patients.  Separate Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI ) algor ithm \nnot required.  \n9. Include specific pediatric recommendations. \n10. Trauma airway management should be rehearsed with your trauma team on a regular basis to include role assignments and familiarization with difficult airway management and surgical airway equipm ent. \nPERFORMANCE  IMPROVEMENT   (PI)  MONITORING  \nPOPULATION  OF  INTEREST  \n All patients who received ETT/cricothyroidotomy/ supraglottic  airway/NPA  \n All patients with compromised airway (initial GCS < 8 or AIS head and neck ≥ 3 or AIS face ≥ 3, \narrival/transport or initial ED SpO2 < 90%, arrival/transport or initial ED ETCO2 > 50).  \nINTENT   (EXPECTED   OUTCOMES)  \n All injured patients who present with obtundation (GCS<8), apnea, respiratory distress or insufficiency, \nairway obstruction, or impending airway loss will have a secure and definitive airway established \nexpeditiously upon arrival to a Role 2 or Role 3.   \n SpO2 is maintained between ≥ 90% and 96%. SpO2 >96% is not necessary.  \n \nAirway M anagement of Traumatic Injuries  CPG ID: 39 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  3 PERFORMANCE/ADHERENCE  METRIC S \n1. Number and percentage of patients in the population of interest who had a secure and definitive airway \n(endotracheal tube, cricothyroidotomy, tracheostomy) established or verified on arrival to Role 2 or 3, \nor documentation of appropriate intervention.  \n2. Number and percentage of patients in the population of interest with initial ED SpO2 < 90%, < 80%, \n<70%, <60%.  \n3. Number and percentage of patients who had definitive airway (endotracheal tube, cricothyroidotomy, \ntracheostomy) with ETCO2 documented at the same role of care where the procedure is do ne. \nDATA   SOURCE  \n Patient Record  \n Department of Defense Trauma Registry (DoDTR)  \nSYSTEM  REPORTING  &  FREQUENCY  \nThe above constitutes the minimum criteria for PI monitoring of this CPG.  System reporting will be performed annually; additional performance im provement monitoring and system reporting may be performed as needed.  \nThe system review and data analysis will be performed by J TS Chief  and the JTS  PI Branch.  \nRESPONSIBILITY  \nIt is the trauma team leader’s responsibility to ensure familiarity, appropriate compliance and PI monitoring at the local level with this CPG.  \nAll Health Care Providers  \n1. Will be familiar with the guidelines for performance of trauma airway management.  \n2. Will be familiar with the guidelines for performance of rapid sequence intubation. \n3. Will be familiar with alternative airway devices mentioned in guidelines for trauma airway management.  \n4. Will provide feedback and  suggested CPG changes to the J TS Chief  and/ or Program Manager.  \nThe Chief, Emergency/Anesthesia/Surgery  \nAt each Level III facility, the chief  will coordinate with the JTS  Chief  on the appropriateness of the guidelines \nbeing used and provide input for updates on an as needed basis.  \nThe JTS Chief   \n1. Will be the subject matter expert on the trauma airway management CPG to be used in the US Central \nCommand Area of Responsibility . \n2. Will review annually and update the CPG as  needed.  \nREFERENCES \n1. Eastridge BJ, Mabry RL, Seguin P, et al.

This Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) provides a clear, step- by-step guide for properly setting up\nthe UPAC with each of the fielded ventilators and  in the manual configuration using assisted ventilation\nwith the self -inflating bag. It ensures anesthesia providers across all services can deliver safe and\neffective anesthesia to our warfighters.\nB. The capability to deliver low -resistance portable inhalational anesthesia without any electrical\npower, whether with or without a portable ventilator or a compressed oxygen source, is a fundamental\nrequirement for Forward Surgical Teams operating in austere and resource -constrained environments.\nThe UPAC Drawover is currently the only alternative available for military anesthesia providers in remote locations to fulfill these specifications. This CPG will emphasize the importance of having a good working knowledge of the UPAC Drawover and its versatility by using a portable ventilator as a force\nmultiplier to provide mechanical ventilation while delivering a volatile agent .\n1, 2, 8, 9\nC. Anesthesia providers in Forward Resuscitative Surgical Detachments (FRSDs) or ad hoc surgical\nteams may have limited or no experience with the UPAC as a delivery system for general anesthesia. As\nthe U.S. military has modernized, new methods of mechanical ventilation have been fielded to support\nforward -deployed anesthesia providers. These ventilators include the HAMILTON -T1, Impact Uni -Vent\n731 (Impact 731) , and the SAVe II. The HAMILTON -T1 and Impact  731 are the most readily available to\nthe FRSDs. While the SAVeII is available to some FRSDs, it is not recommended for long -term use and\nshould only be used when other ventilators are not available.1-5\nD. This CPG exclusively describes the utilization of the UPAC vaporizer in the push-through\nconfiguration when using current ventilators. Although there has been historical utilization of the  UPAC\nDrawover in the pull -through configuration with the Impact 754 and 731 ventilators, the utilization of\nthe HAMILTON -T1 in this configuration, while employing high- pressure oxygen (45 -55 psi), is not\nrecommended. This specific setup with the HAMILTON -T1 carries a substantial risk of causing\nbarotrauma, rendering it highly undesirable and strongly discouraged.\nE. This CPG will describe the UPAC Drawover in a manual configuration  using the self- inflating bag,\nnon- rebreathing valve, and scavenger adaptor (G.A.S.) with corrugated tubing for the exhaled gases.\nThis setup gives the anesthesia provider the ability to perform a general anesthetic with a volatile agent\nwithout any need for power.1, 2\nF. The CPG will address the practical challenges of using the UPAC Drawover with currently fielded\nventilators as it pertains to preoxygenation and emergence and include current recommendations.\nHow to Manage Mechanical Ventilation When Using the UPAC Vaporizer  Feb 2025\n4 III.

Waste Anesthetic Gas Scavenger Setup\nIt is helpful to remove the expiratory valve set from T -1 to appropriately attach the scavenger tubing. To\nprevent obstruction of the scav enger tubing, the HAMI LTON T -1 should be elevated, or a right angle\nadaptor can be used. Obstruction of the scav enger tubing will limit expiratory flow and may manifest as\nhigh PEEP and inspiratory pressure.\nThe corrugated scavenger tubing is not included in the HAMILTON T -1 circuit. Respiratory tubing with a\nstandard internal diameter of 22mm is needed to facilitate this portion of the setup. This scavenger\ntubing should be routed out of the OR area, and not attached to any direct suction source (maintain passive waste anesthetic gas scavenging). Recommend using wire mesh or the standard UPAC dust cap (Figure 1.7) to prevent debris or insects from entering and occluding waste anesthetic gas tubing.\nD.

If the provider wishes to use the UPAC during induction, they must use a self -inflating bag (Ambu -Bag\nor Jackson Rees)  to provide manual ventilation to the patient and confirm endotracheal intubation. The provider\nmust also emerge the patient using a self -inflating bag or by setting the ventilator on “spontaneous” (if available)\nand emerging with the UPAC in the “Off” dial position.\nQ: How do you preoxygenate and mask ventilate the patient when using portable ventilator ?\nA: Preoxygenation can be achieved using a non -rebreather mask or by using a self-inflating resuscitat ing device\nsuch as a Ambu -Bag or Jackson Rees  Circuit connected to an auxiliary oxygen source. The same setup should be\nused during emergence and extubation.\nQ: How to measure EtCO2 when using the UPAC Drawover with the various ventilators ?\nA: Measuring EtCO2 can be accomplished by either using the CAPNOSTAT-5 Mainstream or Sidestream sensor for\nthe HAMILTON-T1, a Sidestream sensor with  supported Propaq Monitors, or the versatile and portable EMMA\ncapnography sensor  (Figure 29 -1).\nQ: Does the CPG address the use of the UPAC vaporizer in a pull -through configuration?\nA: No, the current version of the CPG represents the use of  the UPAC in a push -through configuration, meaning\nthe ventilator pushes air and oxygen over the volatile agent in the UPAC for delivery to the patient. The pull -\nthrough configuration should NOT  be used with the HAMILTON- T1 and is highly discouraged .\nQ: Why is the use of the UPAC in a pull -through configuration not discussed in this CPG?\nA: The HAMILTON- T1 UPAC pull -through configuration, when coupled with high pressure oxygen from a cylinder,\nhas demonstrated excessively high peak inspiratory pressures and delivered tidal volume on multiple occasions in\ntest scenarios. Specifically, during simulated emergence when changing from low FiO2 to > 0.97 while using\ncompressed oxygen from a high -pressure source (regulated H- cylinder or wall supply with pressure of 45- 55 psi) ,\nit has been observed in numerous test scenarios that the HAMILTON -T1 delivers up to 90  cmH2O inspiratory\npressure and excessively high tidal volumes . While the Impact 731 and 754 have been used by multiple anesthesia\nproviders in the pull -through  configuration in deployed and training environments successfully, the effect of\nintroducing anesthetic vapor into any of these portable ventilators is unknown. Based on communica tion with the\nengineering branch at Hamilton Medical, using the T -1 and UPAC with this configuration is be considered “off\nlabel use”  by the manufacturer. It is specifically omitted in the CPG and SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THE PULL -\nTHROUGH CONFIGURATION .\nQ: In what ways can supplemental oxygen be added to the delivered gases?\nA: Low pressure oxygen, as delivered from a deployable oxygen concentrator, can be added via the supplemental oxygen inlet fitting on the side of the UPAC or the yellow oxygen inlet fitting on the circuit attachment side of the HAMILTON- T1. High pressure oxygen from a cylinder with a regulator can be attached via the diameter index\nsafety system (DISS) fitting on the ventilators discussed in the CPG (except for the SAVeII).\nQ: What are the FiO2 and flow limitations?\nA: If the oxygen concentrator being used in a deployed setting has a maximum flow rate of 6 liters per minute, the\ndelivered FiO2 will vary from a high of 0.78 FiO2 (78%) at a minute ventilation of 2.5 liters per minute to a low of 0.44 FiO2 (44%). These values are based on anecdotal evidence a nd recent bench research study’s unpublished\nsecondary analysis data. If higher flow rates are possible, these values will increase as well.\nHow to Manage Mechanical Ventilation When Using the UPAC Vaporizer  Feb 2025\n27\nFigure 41.

Added supporting references.   \n \n \nHow to Manage Mechanical Ventilation When Using the UPAC Vaporizer  Feb 2025  \n3 II. Introduction  \nA. This Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) provides a clear, step- by-step guide for properly setting up \nthe UPAC with each of the fielded ventilators and  in the manual configuration using assisted ventilation \nwith the self -inflating bag. It ensures anesthesia providers across all services can deliver safe and \neffective anesthesia to our warfighters.  \nB. The capability to deliver low -resistance portable inhalational anesthesia without any electrical \npower, whether with or without a portable ventilator or a compressed oxygen source, is a fundamental \nrequirement for Forward Surgical Teams operating in austere and resource -constrained environments. \nThe UPAC Drawover is currently the only alternative available for military anesthesia providers in remote locations to fulfill these specifications. This CPG will emphasize the importance of having a good working knowledge of the UPAC Drawover and its versatility by using a portable ventilator as a force \nmultiplier to provide mechanical ventilation while delivering a volatile agent .\n1, 2, 8, 9 \nC. Anesthesia providers in Forward Resuscitative Surgical Detachments (FRSDs) or ad hoc surgical \nteams may have limited or no experience with the UPAC as a delivery system for general anesthesia. As \nthe U.S. military has modernized, new methods of mechanical ventilation have been fielded to support \nforward -deployed anesthesia providers. These ventilators include the HAMILTON -T1, Impact Uni -Vent \n731 (Impact 731) , and the SAVe II. The HAMILTON -T1 and Impact  731 are the most readily available to \nthe FRSDs. While the SAVeII is available to some FRSDs, it is not recommended for long -term use and \nshould only be used when other ventilators are not available.1-5 \nD. This CPG exclusively describes the utilization of the UPAC vaporizer in the push-through \nconfiguration when using current ventilators. Although there has been historical utilization of the  UPAC \nDrawover in the pull -through configuration with the Impact 754 and 731 ventilators, the utilization of \nthe HAMILTON -T1 in this configuration, while employing high- pressure oxygen (45 -55 psi), is not \nrecommended. This specific setup with the HAMILTON -T1 carries a substantial risk of causing \nbarotrauma, rendering it highly undesirable and strongly discouraged.  \nE. This CPG will describe the UPAC Drawover in a manual configuration  using the self- inflating bag, \nnon- rebreathing valve, and scavenger adaptor (G.A.S.) with corrugated tubing for the exhaled gases.  \nThis setup gives the anesthesia provider the ability to perform a general anesthetic with a volatile agent \nwithout any need for power.1, 2 \nF. The CPG will address the practical challenges of using the UPAC Drawover with currently fielded \nventilators as it pertains to preoxygenation and emergence and include current recommendations.  \n \n  \n \nHow to Manage Mechanical Ventilation When Using the UPAC Vaporizer  Feb 2025  \n4 III.

Waste Anesthetic Gas Scavenger Setup  \nIt is helpful to remove the expiratory valve set from T -1 to appropriately attach the scavenger tubing. To \nprevent obstruction of the scav enger tubing, the HAMI LTON T -1 should be elevated, or a right angle \nadaptor can be used. Obstruction of the scav enger tubing will limit expiratory flow and may manifest as \nhigh PEEP and inspiratory pressure.  \nThe corrugated scavenger tubing is not included in the HAMILTON T -1 circuit. Respiratory tubing with a \nstandard internal diameter of 22mm is needed to facilitate this portion of the setup. This scavenger \ntubing should be routed out of the OR area, and not attached to any direct suction source (maintain passive waste anesthetic gas scavenging). Recommend using wire mesh or the standard UPAC dust cap (Figure 1.7) to prevent debris or insects from entering and occluding waste anesthetic gas tubing.  \nD.

If the provider wishes to use the UPAC during induction, they must use a self -inflating bag (Ambu -Bag \nor Jackson Rees)  to provide manual ventilation to the patient and confirm endotracheal intubation. The provider \nmust also emerge the patient using a self -inflating bag or by setting the ventilator on “spontaneous” (if available) \nand emerging with the UPAC in the “Off” dial position.  \nQ: How do you preoxygenate and mask ventilate the patient when using portable ventilator ? \nA: Preoxygenation can be achieved using a non -rebreather mask or by using a self-inflating resuscitat ing device  \nsuch as a Ambu -Bag or Jackson Rees  Circuit connected to an auxiliary oxygen source. The same setup should be \nused during emergence and extubation.  \nQ: How to measure EtCO2 when using the UPAC Drawover with the various ventilators ? \nA: Measuring EtCO2 can be accomplished by either using the CAPNOSTAT-5 Mainstream or Sidestream sensor for \nthe HAMILTON-T1, a Sidestream sensor with  supported Propaq Monitors, or the versatile and portable EMMA \ncapnography sensor  (Figure 29 -1). \nQ: Does the CPG address the use of the UPAC vaporizer in a pull -through configuration?  \nA: No, the current version of the CPG represents the use of  the UPAC in a push -through configuration, meaning \nthe ventilator pushes air and oxygen over the volatile agent in the UPAC for delivery to the patient. The pull -\nthrough configuration should NOT  be used with the HAMILTON- T1 and is highly discouraged . \nQ: Why is the use of the UPAC in a pull -through configuration not discussed in this CPG?  \nA: The HAMILTON- T1 UPAC pull -through configuration, when coupled with high pressure oxygen from a cylinder, \nhas demonstrated excessively high peak inspiratory pressures and delivered tidal volume on multiple occasions in \ntest scenarios. Specifically, during simulated emergence when changing from low FiO2 to > 0.97 while using \ncompressed oxygen from a high -pressure source (regulated H- cylinder or wall supply with pressure of 45- 55 psi) , \nit has been observed in numerous test scenarios that the HAMILTON -T1 delivers up to 90  cmH2O inspiratory \npressure and excessively high tidal volumes . While the Impact 731 and 754 have been used by multiple anesthesia \nproviders in the pull -through  configuration in deployed and training environments successfully, the effect of \nintroducing anesthetic vapor into any of these portable ventilators is unknown. Based on communica tion with the \nengineering branch at Hamilton Medical, using the T -1 and UPAC with this configuration is be considered “off \nlabel use”  by the manufacturer. It is specifically omitted in the CPG and SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THE PULL -\nTHROUGH CONFIGURATION . \nQ: In what ways can supplemental oxygen be added to the delivered gases?  \nA: Low pressure oxygen, as delivered from a deployable oxygen concentrator, can be added via the supplemental oxygen inlet fitting on the side of the UPAC or the yellow oxygen inlet fitting on the circuit attachment side of the HAMILTON- T1. High pressure oxygen from a cylinder with a regulator can be attached via the diameter index \nsafety system (DISS) fitting on the ventilators discussed in the CPG (except for the SAVeII).  \nQ: What are the FiO2 and flow limitations?  \nA: If the oxygen concentrator being used in a deployed setting has a maximum flow rate of 6 liters per minute, the \ndelivered FiO2 will vary from a high of 0.78 FiO2 (78%) at a minute ventilation of 2.5 liters per minute to a low of 0.44 FiO2 (44%). These values are based on anecdotal evidence a nd recent bench research study’s unpublished \nsecondary analysis data. If higher flow rates are possible, these values will increase as well.  \nHow to Manage Mechanical Ventilation When Using the UPAC Vaporizer  Feb 2025  \n27   \nFigure 41.

GOAL\nThe goal of this Clinical Practice Guideline ( CPG) is to provide guidance for the diagnosis, treatment,\nprevention, and mitigation of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP). These guidelines are not intended\nsolely for clinical care, but also to help unit c ommanders and supporting medical components to\nconsider the unique challenges of the management of a common healthcare associated infection in both traditional and expeditionary settings.\nBACKGROUND\nVAP is a common healthcare -associated infection (HAI), but what defines VAP and how it is diagnosed\nhave remained moving targets. Due to wide variations in the surveillance and diagnosis of VAP, the true rate of VAP is unknown, but it is believed to occur in at least 5 -15% of p atients placed on a ventilator.\n1-2\nWhile much of combat casualty care in the  intensive care unit  setting is largely similar to the care of\ntrauma patients in civilian centers, there are several challenges unique  to expeditionary care, ch ief\namong them being microbiological variabilities. Military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are notable for a high number of multi -drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections in combat casualties, particularly\nAcinetobacter calcoaceticus -baumannii comple x (ABC).\n3\nSeveral benchmark studies, along with other data, implicate nosocomial transmission as the major contributing source of these infections .\n4-6  An outbreak of multi- drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii -\ncalcoaceticus complex infections in the U.S. military health-care system associated with military operations in Iraq described cluster outbreak strains of ABC within the military healthcare system\nsuggesting that, at least in the case of ABC, the bacteria has spread from field hospitals in Iraq to those\nwithin the continental U .S.\n7  Additionally, bacteria identical to those found in clinical isolates have been\ncultured from numerous environmental surfaces from U.S. medical treatment facilities within Iraq.\nThese experiences have been replicated in more recent times with similar results, indicating that this\nissue is endemic and not related to individuals or groups of service members.\nDIAGNOSIS\nThe diagnosis of VAP is difficult and varies  across institutions. American Thoracic Society and Infectious\nDisease Society of America guidelines define VAP as a “new lung infiltrate plus clinical evidence that the\ninfiltrate is of an infectious origin, which include the new onset of fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis,\nand decline in oxygenation” which develops >48 hours after endotracheal intubation .8\nDetermination of whether a pulmonary abnormality is of infectious origin is particularly challenging, especially in trauma patients. Blast injury and penetrating chest injury patients are highly likely to have injury-related chest radiography findings that may obscure or mimic infections.\nPatients on mechanical ventilation are at risk for a variety of serious complications in addition to VAP, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, lobar atelectasis, and pulmonary edema. The Centers for Disease Control have large scale, ongoing quality projects designed to validate and streamline surveillance measures, though these have yet to be validated for a\npriori diagnosis of various v entilator associated conditions.  Despite the changing language surrounding\nventilator associated conditions , the strongest and most consistent evidence continues to support daily\nVentilator Associated Pneumonia   CPG ID: 45\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  4 sedation interruptions and spontaneous breathing trials for aggressive liberation from mechanical\nventilation as the facto rs most likely to reduce all ventilator associated conditions.9\nPROPHYLACTIC  MEASURES\nGENERAL  MEASURES:\n1. Conduct active surveillance for ventilator associated conditions ,10 including but not limited to :\n Ventilator associated pneumonia\n Pulmonary edema\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome\n Atelectasis\n2. Perform daily assessments of readiness for extubation including:\n Daily sedation interruptions for patients in whom it is not contra -indicated (e.g., severe c erebral\nedema) .\n Protocoled conduction of spontaneous breathing trials for all patients meeting the following criteria:\nRequired criteria\na. The cause of the respiratory failure has improved .\nb. PaO2/FiO2 ≥150 or SpO2 ≥90 percent on FiO2 ≤ 50 percent and positiv e end- expiratory\npressure (PEEP) ≤ 8 cmH2O\nc. pH >7.25\nd. Hemodynamic stability (no or low dose vasopressor medications)\ne. Able to initiate a spontaneous inspiratory effort .\nAdditional criteria (optional criteria)\na. Hemoglobin ≥7 mg/dL\nb. Core temperature ≤38 to 38.5°Centigrade\nc. Mental status awake and alert or easily arousable with ability to protect airway.\nSTAFF  EDUCATION  PRIORITIES\n1. Epidemiology of Ventilator Associated Events\n2. Infection -control procedures for prevention of VAP\na. Avoid intubation and utilize non -invasive ventilation when possible.\nb. ABCDEF bundle11 (see Appendix C )\nc. VAP bundle components and use12 (See below.)\nVentilator Associated Pneumonia   CPG ID: 45\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 3. Periodic audits of the use of guidelines with aggressive education and enforcement of procedures.\nVAP   BUNDLE   COMPONENTS\nRESPIRATORY   EQUIPMENT   MANAGEMENT\nBreathing   Circuits  with  Humidifiers\nChange the circuit when it is visibly soiled or mechanically malfunctioning. Do not routinely change on\nthe basis of duration of use of the breathing circuit (i.e.  ventilator tubing and exhalation valve and the\nattached humidifier) that is in use on an individual patient.\nBreathing   Circuit/Tubing   Condensation\nPeriodically drain and discard any condensation that collects in the tubing of mechanical ventilators, taking precautions not to allow condensation to drain toward the patient. Wear gloves to perform the procedure and/or when handling the fluid. Decontaminate hands with soap and water (if hands are visibly soiled) or with an alcohol -based hand solution before and after performing the procedure or\nhandling the fluid.\nHumidifiers\nUse sterile (not distilled, nonsterile) water to fill bubbling humidifiers. Bet ween the uses of reusable\nhand -powered resuscitation bags on different patients, sterilize or subject to high -level disinfection. Do\nnot routinely sterilize or disinfect the internal machinery of anesthesia equipment. Between uses on\ndifferent patients, clean reusable components of the breathing system or patient circuit (e.g., tracheal\ntube or face mask) inspiratory and expiratory breathing tubing, y -piece, reservoir bag, humidifier, and\ntubing, and then sterilize or subject them to high -level liquid chemical disinfection or pasteurization in\naccordance with the device manufacturers’ instructions for their reprocessing.\nKeep all ventilators covered when not in use to reduce dust accumulation on devices.\nPREVENTION   OF  PERSON -TO-PERSON  TRANSMISSION   OF  BACTERIA\nCohorting\nImplement patient and st aff cohorting whenever possible by using geographically distinct areas of care.\nIn the deployed setting, this includes separating Host National from non -Host National patient  due to\ndifferences in the microbiomes . Disinfect all patient care equipment after each patient transfer.\nTerminally clean rooms between patients and consider periodic (monthly) ICU/ICU subunit closure for\nthorough cleaning and disinfection. In deployed settings, this should be conducted as regularly as field conditions permit.\nStandard Precautions\nDecontaminate hands by washing either with antimicrobial soap and water (if hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with blood or body fluids), or by using an alcohol -based waterless antiseptic age nt if\nhands are not visibly soiled. Use personal protective equipment  based on  clinical circumstance.\nVentilator Associated Pneumonia   CPG ID: 45\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 Contact precautions with gloves and gown for all patient contact for patients infected or suspected with\nepidemiologically significant pathogens, specif ically MDR Acinetobacter spp., ESBL -producing Klebsiella\nspp. and Escherichia coli, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin -resistant Enterococcus\nspp., and methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Decontaminate hands before and after patient\ncontact and use gloves as below.\nGloves\nWear gloves for handling secretions or objects contaminated with secretions of any patient. Change gloves and decontaminate hands as described previously between contacts with different patients. When anticipatin g becoming soiled from secretions, wear a gown and change it after soiling occurs and\nbefore providing care to another patient.\nCare of patients with Tracheostomy\nPerform tracheostomy care under aseptic conditions. When changing a tracheostomy tube, wear a gown and mask, use aseptic technique. Providers should familiarize themselves with manufacturers recommendations regarding the quality and frequency recommended for tracheostomy care. Additionally, the life expectancy of inner cannula is variable depending on the product used (e.g., 24h to\n29 days). Tracheostomy care orders should be written specific to the product used.\nSuctioning of respiratory tract secretions\nAppropriate to use either the multiuse closed system suction (Ballard) catheter or the single- use open\nsystem suction catheter. Patients persistently on the ventilator should have a Ballard system in line, while those intermittently on or off the ventilator with a tracheostomy in place can have the open\nsuction employed as appropriate. If the open-system suction is employed, use a sterile, single -use\ncatheter and sterile technique when suctioning. Use only sterile fluid to remove secretions from the\nsuction catheter if the catheter is to be used for re -entry into the patient’s lower respiratory tr act.\nPREVENTION  OF  MUCUS   PLUGGING  (ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE)\n If feasible, use an endotracheal tube (Hi Lo Tube) with a dorsal lumen above the endotracheal cuff to allow drainage of tracheal secretions that accumulate in the patient’s subglottic area.\n Before  deflating the cuff of an endotracheal tube in preparation for extubation, ensure that\nsecretions are cleared from above the tube cuff.\nPREVENTION   OF  ASPIRATION RELATED   INFECTION  (GASTROINTESTINAL)\n Head of bed elevation: In the absence of contraindication(s), elevate the head of bed at an angle of\n30° to 45° of a patient at high risk for aspiration (e.g., traumatic brain injury, mechanically assisted ventilation).\n As soon as the clinical indications for their use are resolved, remove devices such as endotracheal, tracheostomy, and/or enteral tubes from patients.\n Feeding tube v erification: Verify appropriate placement of the feeding tube prior to use.\n Due to recent studies questioning the value and safety\n12 of chlorhexidine-based oral care, this\nguideline does not advocate for the routine use of chlorhexidine-based oral decontamination.\nVentilator Associated Pneumonia  CPG ID: 45\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 Routine oral hygiene with a tooth brush or oral sponge should continue to be provided with the\ngoals of removal of dental plaque and other debris from teeth, tongue and oral mucosa.\nPREVENTION  OF  POSTOPERATIVE  PNEUMONIA\nEncourage all postoperative patients to take deep breaths, move about the bed, and ambulateunless medically contraindicated.\nUse incentive spirometry on postoperative patients.\nIncorporate rehabilitation therapy as early as possible in the post -operative period.\nAntibiotic therapy:\nSurgical prophylaxis: Minimize the duration and spectrum of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis in\naccordance with the JTS Infection Prevention Clinical Practice Guideline, 08 Aug 2016 .13\nSuspected infection:  Initial therapy should be broad spectrum and informed by each facility’s\nantibio tic susceptibility patterns , if available . When possible, cultures should be obtained prior\nto initiation of antibiotic therapy. Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines state thatnon-invasive sampling with semi -quantitative cultures is the prefer red methodology. Therapy\nshould be tailored based on culture results and should be given for a 7 day course.14\nAEROMEDICAL  EVACUATION  CONSIDERATIONS\n1.Aeromedical Evacuation from any AOR to CONUS can require multiple flights over the course of daysbefore  the patient arrives at his or her final destination.\n2.All patients, including those on mechanical ventilation, will experience a decrease in PaO2 asambient pressure decreases.\nPatients with marginal gas exchange will require additional support during f light.\nCabin altitude restriction will lessen the impact on gas exchange.\n3.All ventilated patients should have the head of bed elevated at least 30° unless there is a\ncontraindication.\n4.All ventilated patients require gastric decompression prior to flight. Barring specific surgicalindications for nasal placement, orogastric tube is preferred to nasogastric tube to prevent sinusitis.\n5.If NPO or not tolerating fluids, consider adding IV fluid s to help prevent dehydration during flight.\nConsider increasing maintenance IV rate due to dry air at altitude and increased rate of insensibleloss.\n6.Consider repeat CXR prior to flight if > 12 hours has elapsed since most recent one or clinicalcondition has changed significantly.\n7.Do not extubate patient less than 4 ho urs prior to take off.\n8.Consider enteral nutrition according to\nJTS Nutritional Support Using Enteral and Parenteral\nMethods  CPG.15 Tube feeds not administered through a small bowel feeding tube should be\ndiscontinued prior to flight.\nVentilator Associated Pneumonia   CPG ID: 45\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 9. Patients with decreased mobility require routine Deep Venous Thrombosis  prophylaxis. See the JTS\nCPG The Prevention of Deep Venous Thrombosis – Inferior Vena Cava Filter, 02 Aug 2016 .16\n If anatomically feasible, sequential compression devices should be used.\n Enoxaparin 30mg sq BID or heparin 5000 IU sq q8h may be used as chemoprophylaxis providing\npatient does not have potential hemorrhagic issues.\n10. Gastric ulcer prevention should be provided if indicated\nPERFORMANCE  IMPROVEMENT   (PI)  MONITORING\nPOPULATION   OF  INTEREST\nAll patients receiving mechanical ventilation.\nINTENT   (EXPECTED  OUTCOMES)\n Incidence of VAP is tracked in each ICU and for the system as a whole.\n Mechanically ventilated patients receive VAP bundle.\nPERFORMANCE/ADHERENC E  M ETRICS\n Number and percentage of mechanically ventilated patients who develop VAP, tracked for each role 3 and 4 separately and overall for the system as a whole.\n Number and percentage of patients who have daily sedation interruption and spontaneous breathing trial or contraindication documented.\nDATA  SOURCES\n Patient Record\n Department of Defense Trauma Registry (DoDTR)\nSYSTEM REPORTING & F REQUENCY\nThe above constitutes the minimum criteria for PI monitoring of this CPG. System reporting will be performed annually; additional PI monitoring and system reporting may be performed as needed.\nThe system rev iew and data analysis will be performed by the Joint Trauma System (JTS) Director, JTS\nProgram Manager, and the JTS PI  Branch.\nRESPONSIBILITIES\nIt is the trauma team leader’s responsibility to ensure familiarity, appropriate compliance and PI monitoring at  the local level with this CPG.\nVentilator Associated Pneumonia  CPG ID: 45\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9 REFERENCES\n1 Skrupky LP, McConnell K, Dallas J, et al.

This applies to off-label uses\nwith patients who are armed forces members.\nBACKGROUND\nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of  FDA-approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are\nusually not subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved\nuses of approved drugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investi gational new drugs.” These circumstances\ninclude such uses as part of clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved uses may also be subject to special regulations.\nADDITIONAL INFORMAT ION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS\nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it\ndoes not imply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to\nbe the “standard of care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the\nresponsible health care practitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment\naltern atives. The decision is for the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the\npractitioner- patient relationship.\nADDITIONAL PROCEDURE S\nBalanced Discussion\nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by\nthe FDA. Further, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any\nsuch data that suggest caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA- issued warnings.\nQuality Assurance Monitoring\nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring\nof outcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate cli nical records is\nunderscored.\nInformation to Patients\nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an\nunusual off -label use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, c onsideration will be\ngiven to including in an appendix an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product. Information to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a DoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose;\nand c) the potential risks associated with such use."

Judgment  3 GOAL  \nThe goal of this Clinical Practice Guideline ( CPG) is to provide guidance for the diagnosis, treatment, \nprevention, and mitigation of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP). These guidelines are not intended \nsolely for clinical care, but also to help unit c ommanders and supporting medical components to \nconsider the unique challenges of the management of a common healthcare associated infection in both traditional and expeditionary settings.  \nBACKGROUND  \nVAP is a common healthcare -associated infection (HAI), but what defines VAP and how it is diagnosed \nhave remained moving targets. Due to wide variations in the surveillance and diagnosis of VAP, the true rate of VAP is unknown, but it is believed to occur in at least 5 -15% of p atients placed on a ventilator.\n1-2 \nWhile much of combat casualty care in the  intensive care unit  setting is largely similar to the care of \ntrauma patients in civilian centers, there are several challenges unique  to expeditionary care, ch ief \namong them being microbiological variabilities. Military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are notable for a high number of multi -drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections in combat casualties, particularly \nAcinetobacter calcoaceticus -baumannii comple x (ABC).\n3  \nSeveral benchmark studies, along with other data, implicate nosocomial transmission as the major contributing source of these infections .\n4-6  An outbreak of multi- drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii -\ncalcoaceticus complex infections in the U.S. military health-care system associated with military operations in Iraq described cluster outbreak strains of ABC within the military healthcare system \nsuggesting that, at least in the case of ABC, the bacteria has spread from field hospitals in Iraq to those \nwithin the continental U .S.\n7  Additionally, bacteria identical to those found in clinical isolates have been \ncultured from numerous environmental surfaces from U.S. medical treatment facilities within Iraq.  \nThese experiences have been replicated in more recent times with similar results, indicating that this \nissue is endemic and not related to individuals or groups of service members.  \nDIAGNOSIS  \nThe diagnosis of VAP is difficult and varies  across institutions. American Thoracic Society and Infectious \nDisease Society of America guidelines define VAP as a “new lung infiltrate plus clinical evidence that the \ninfiltrate is of an infectious origin, which include the new onset of fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, \nand decline in oxygenation” which develops >48 hours after endotracheal intubation .8 \nDetermination of whether a pulmonary abnormality is of infectious origin is particularly challenging, especially in trauma patients. Blast injury and penetrating chest injury patients are highly likely to have injury-related chest radiography findings that may obscure or mimic infections.  \nPatients on mechanical ventilation are at risk for a variety of serious complications in addition to VAP, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, lobar atelectasis, and pulmonary edema. The Centers for Disease Control have large scale, ongoing quality projects designed to validate and streamline surveillance measures, though these have yet to be validated for a \npriori diagnosis of various v entilator associated conditions.  Despite the changing language surrounding \nventilator associated conditions , the strongest and most consistent evidence continues to support daily \nVentilator Associated Pneumonia   CPG ID: 45 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  4 sedation interruptions and spontaneous breathing trials for aggressive liberation from mechanical \nventilation as the facto rs most likely to reduce all ventilator associated conditions.9   \nPROPHYLACTIC  MEASURES \nGENERAL  MEASURES:  \n1. Conduct active surveillance for ventilator associated conditions ,10 including but not limited to : \n Ventilator associated pneumonia  \n Pulmonary edema  \n Acute respiratory distress syndrome  \n Atelectasis  \n2. Perform daily assessments of readiness for extubation including:  \n Daily sedation interruptions for patients in whom it is not contra -indicated (e.g., severe c erebral \nedema) .  \n Protocoled conduction of spontaneous breathing trials for all patients meeting the following criteria: \nRequired criteria  \na. The cause of the respiratory failure has improved . \nb. PaO2/FiO2 ≥150 or SpO2 ≥90 percent on FiO2 ≤ 50 percent and positiv e end- expiratory \npressure (PEEP) ≤ 8 cmH2O  \nc. pH >7.25  \nd. Hemodynamic stability (no or low dose vasopressor medications)  \ne. Able to initiate a spontaneous inspiratory effort . \nAdditional criteria (optional criteria)  \na. Hemoglobin ≥7 mg/dL  \nb. Core temperature ≤38 to 38.5°Centigrade  \nc. Mental status awake and alert or easily arousable with ability to protect airway.  \nSTAFF  EDUCATION  PRIORITIES  \n1. Epidemiology of Ventilator Associated Events  \n2. Infection -control procedures for prevention of VAP  \na. Avoid intubation and utilize non -invasive ventilation when possible. \nb. ABCDEF bundle11 (see Appendix C ) \nc. VAP bundle components and use12 (See below.) \nVentilator Associated Pneumonia   CPG ID: 45 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 3. Periodic audits of the use of guidelines with aggressive education and enforcement of procedures.  \nVAP   BUNDLE   COMPONENTS  \nRESPIRATORY   EQUIPMENT   MANAGEMENT  \nBreathing   Circuits  with  Humidifiers  \nChange the circuit when it is visibly soiled or mechanically malfunctioning. Do not routinely change on \nthe basis of duration of use of the breathing circuit (i.e.  ventilator tubing and exhalation valve and the \nattached humidifier) that is in use on an individual patient.  \nBreathing   Circuit/Tubing   Condensation \nPeriodically drain and discard any condensation that collects in the tubing of mechanical ventilators, taking precautions not to allow condensation to drain toward the patient. Wear gloves to perform the procedure and/or when handling the fluid. Decontaminate hands with soap and water (if hands are visibly soiled) or with an alcohol -based hand solution before and after performing the procedure or \nhandling the fluid.  \nHumidifiers \nUse sterile (not distilled, nonsterile) water to fill bubbling humidifiers. Bet ween the uses of reusable \nhand -powered resuscitation bags on different patients, sterilize or subject to high -level disinfection. Do \nnot routinely sterilize or disinfect the internal machinery of anesthesia equipment. Between uses on \ndifferent patients, clean reusable components of the breathing system or patient circuit (e.g., tracheal \ntube or face mask) inspiratory and expiratory breathing tubing, y -piece, reservoir bag, humidifier, and \ntubing, and then sterilize or subject them to high -level liquid chemical disinfection or pasteurization in \naccordance with the device manufacturers’ instructions for their reprocessing.  \nKeep all ventilators covered when not in use to reduce dust accumulation on devices.  \nPREVENTION   OF  PERSON -TO-PERSON  TRANSMISSION   OF  BACTERIA   \nCohorting  \nImplement patient and st aff cohorting whenever possible by using geographically distinct areas of care. \nIn the deployed setting, this includes separating Host National from non -Host National patient  due to \ndifferences in the microbiomes . Disinfect all patient care equipment after each patient transfer. \nTerminally clean rooms between patients and consider periodic (monthly) ICU/ICU subunit closure for \nthorough cleaning and disinfection. In deployed settings, this should be conducted as regularly as field conditions permit.   \nStandard Precautions  \nDecontaminate hands by washing either with antimicrobial soap and water (if hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with blood or body fluids), or by using an alcohol -based waterless antiseptic age nt if \nhands are not visibly soiled. Use personal protective equipment  based on  clinical circumstance.   \nVentilator Associated Pneumonia   CPG ID: 45 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 Contact precautions with gloves and gown for all patient contact for patients infected or suspected with \nepidemiologically significant pathogens, specif ically MDR Acinetobacter spp., ESBL -producing Klebsiella \nspp. and Escherichia coli, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin -resistant Enterococcus \nspp., and methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Decontaminate hands before and after patient \ncontact and use gloves as below.  \nGloves  \nWear gloves for handling secretions or objects contaminated with secretions of any patient. Change gloves and decontaminate hands as described previously between contacts with different patients. When anticipatin g becoming soiled from secretions, wear a gown and change it after soiling occurs and \nbefore providing care to another patient.  \nCare of patients with Tracheostomy  \nPerform tracheostomy care under aseptic conditions. When changing a tracheostomy tube, wear a gown and mask, use aseptic technique. Providers should familiarize themselves with manufacturers recommendations regarding the quality and frequency recommended for tracheostomy care. Additionally, the life expectancy of inner cannula is variable depending on the product used (e.g., 24h to \n29 days). Tracheostomy care orders should be written specific to the product used.  \nSuctioning of respiratory tract secretions  \nAppropriate to use either the multiuse closed system suction (Ballard) catheter or the single- use open \nsystem suction catheter. Patients persistently on the ventilator should have a Ballard system in line, while those intermittently on or off the ventilator with a tracheostomy in place can have the open \nsuction employed as appropriate. If the open-system suction is employed, use a sterile, single -use \ncatheter and sterile technique when suctioning. Use only sterile fluid to remove secretions from the \nsuction catheter if the catheter is to be used for re -entry into the patient’s lower respiratory tr act.  \nPREVENTION  OF  MUCUS   PLUGGING  (ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE)  \n If feasible, use an endotracheal tube (Hi Lo Tube) with a dorsal lumen above the endotracheal cuff to allow drainage of tracheal secretions that accumulate in the patient’s subglottic area.  \n Before  deflating the cuff of an endotracheal tube in preparation for extubation, ensure that \nsecretions are cleared from above the tube cuff.  \nPREVENTION   OF  ASPIRATION RELATED   INFECTION  (GASTROINTESTINAL)  \n Head of bed elevation: In the absence of contraindication(s), elevate the head of bed at an angle of \n30° to 45° of a patient at high risk for aspiration (e.g., traumatic brain injury, mechanically assisted ventilation).   \n As soon as the clinical indications for their use are resolved, remove devices such as endotracheal, tracheostomy, and/or enteral tubes from patients.  \n Feeding tube v erification: Verify appropriate placement of the feeding tube prior to use.  \n Due to recent studies questioning the value and safety\n12 of chlorhexidine-based oral care, this \nguideline does not advocate for the routine use of chlorhexidine-based oral decontamination. \nVentilator Associated Pneumonia  CPG ID: 45 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 Routine oral hygiene with a tooth brush or oral sponge should continue to be provided with the \ngoals of removal of dental plaque and other debris from teeth, tongue and oral mucosa. \nPREVENTION  OF  POSTOPERATIVE  PNEUMONIA  \nEncourage all postoperative patients to take deep breaths, move about the bed, and ambulateunless medically contraindicated.\nUse incentive spirometry on postoperative patients.\nIncorporate rehabilitation therapy as early as possible in the post -operative period.\nAntibiotic therapy:\nSurgical prophylaxis: Minimize the duration and spectrum of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis in\naccordance with the JTS Infection Prevention Clinical Practice Guideline, 08 Aug 2016 .13\nSuspected infection:  Initial therapy should be broad spectrum and informed by each facility’s\nantibio tic susceptibility patterns , if available . When possible, cultures should be obtained prior\nto initiation of antibiotic therapy. Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines state thatnon-invasive sampling with semi -quantitative cultures is the prefer red methodology. Therapy\nshould be tailored based on culture results and should be given for a 7 day course.14\nAEROMEDICAL  EVACUATION  CONSIDERATIONS \n1.Aeromedical Evacuation from any AOR to CONUS can require multiple flights over the course of daysbefore  the patient arrives at his or her final destination.\n2.All patients, including those on mechanical ventilation, will experience a decrease in PaO2 asambient pressure decreases.\nPatients with marginal gas exchange will require additional support during f light.\nCabin altitude restriction will lessen the impact on gas exchange.\n3.All ventilated patients should have the head of bed elevated at least 30° unless there is a\ncontraindication.\n4.All ventilated patients require gastric decompression prior to flight. Barring specific surgicalindications for nasal placement, orogastric tube is preferred to nasogastric tube to prevent sinusitis.\n5.If NPO or not tolerating fluids, consider adding IV fluid s to help prevent dehydration during flight.\nConsider increasing maintenance IV rate due to dry air at altitude and increased rate of insensibleloss.\n6.Consider repeat CXR prior to flight if > 12 hours has elapsed since most recent one or clinicalcondition has changed significantly.\n7.Do not extubate patient less than 4 ho urs prior to take off.\n8.Consider enteral nutrition according to \nJTS Nutritional Support Using Enteral and Parenteral\nMethods  CPG.15 Tube feeds not administered through a small bowel feeding tube should be\ndiscontinued prior to flight.\nVentilator Associated Pneumonia   CPG ID: 45 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 9. Patients with decreased mobility require routine Deep Venous Thrombosis  prophylaxis. See the JTS \nCPG The Prevention of Deep Venous Thrombosis – Inferior Vena Cava Filter, 02 Aug 2016 .16 \n If anatomically feasible, sequential compression devices should be used.  \n Enoxaparin 30mg sq BID or heparin 5000 IU sq q8h may be used as chemoprophylaxis providing \npatient does not have potential hemorrhagic issues.  \n10. Gastric ulcer prevention should be provided if indicated   \nPERFORMANCE  IMPROVEMENT   (PI)  MONITORING  \nPOPULATION   OF  INTEREST  \nAll patients receiving mechanical ventilation.  \nINTENT   (EXPECTED  OUTCOMES)  \n Incidence of VAP is tracked in each ICU and for the system as a whole.  \n Mechanically ventilated patients receive VAP bundle.  \nPERFORMANCE/ADHERENC E  M ETRICS  \n Number and percentage of mechanically ventilated patients who develop VAP, tracked for each role 3 and 4 separately and overall for the system as a whole.  \n Number and percentage of patients who have daily sedation interruption and spontaneous breathing trial or contraindication documented.  \nDATA  SOURCES \n Patient Record  \n Department of Defense Trauma Registry (DoDTR)  \nSYSTEM REPORTING & F REQUENCY  \nThe above constitutes the minimum criteria for PI monitoring of this CPG. System reporting will be performed annually; additional PI monitoring and system reporting may be performed as needed.  \nThe system rev iew and data analysis will be performed by the Joint Trauma System (JTS) Director, JTS \nProgram Manager, and the JTS PI  Branch.  \nRESPONSIBILITIES  \nIt is the trauma team leader’s responsibility to ensure familiarity, appropriate compliance and PI monitoring at  the local level with this CPG.  \n \nVentilator Associated Pneumonia  CPG ID: 45 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9 REFERENCES \n1 Skrupky LP, McConnell K, Dallas J, et al.

This applies to off-label uses \nwith patients who are armed forces members.   \nBACKGROUND  \nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of  FDA-approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are \nusually not subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved \nuses of approved drugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investi gational new drugs.” These circumstances \ninclude such uses as part of clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved uses may also be subject to special regulations.   \nADDITIONAL INFORMAT ION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS \nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it \ndoes not imply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to \nbe the “standard of care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the \nresponsible health care practitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment \naltern atives. The decision is for the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the \npractitioner- patient relationship.  \nADDITIONAL PROCEDURE S \nBalanced Discussion  \nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by \nthe FDA. Further, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any \nsuch data that suggest caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA- issued warnings.  \nQuality Assurance Monitoring  \nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring \nof outcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate cli nical records is \nunderscored.  \nInformation to Patients  \nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an \nunusual off -label use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, c onsideration will be \ngiven to including in an appendix an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product. Information to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a DoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose; \nand c) the potential risks associated with such use.  \n",

Ventilator management is resource intensive and demanding\nwhich might not make it appropriate for all tactical situations. If a patient is maintaining their airway and has appropriate\noxygenation and ventilation, they should not be intubated by prehospital providers for transport from point of injury\n(POI) to the first battlefi eld role of care.\nIntubation and providing mechanical ventilation are not without risk.\nThe benefits should outweigh the attributable cost and risk of\nmanaging the mechanically ventilated patient, especially within the\naustere/ battlefield setting.  Pathology associated with failure to\noxygenate and failure to ventilate wi ll most often require definitive\nairway interventions and appropriate mechanical ventilator support.\nAt times, it may only serve as a temporizing measure while seeking\ndefinitive critical care. Initiation  of mechanical ventilation must be\nguided by clinical suspicion of underlying pathophysiology and clear\ncriteria.  A definitive airway is  required for effective mechanical\nventilation  and these patients require sedation – both mechanical ventilation and sedation may  make a hypotensive patient\nmore hypotensive and could result in hemodynamic instability.  Thoughtful consideration for the requirement of  mechanical\nventilation must occur .  See the JTS Airway Management of Traumatic Injuries and Analgesia and Sedation Management\nduring Prolonged Field Care  CPG. In patients with hemorrhagic shock requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation,\nremember the general principle of “resuscitation before intubation .” Utilize airway adjuncts i f the patient ’s airway can be\nmaintained adequately during initial resuscitation efforts with blood products. In an under -resuscitated patient, cardiac\narrest can occur when induction and paralytic medications are given during rapid sequence intubation.\nThe intent of this CPG is to provide the non -critical care trained  medical personnel with guidance on basic ventilator\nmanagement .  Expanded information on definitions, ventilator terms and modes can be found in Appendix A and B.  In the\nprolonged care setting, telemedicine  consultation should be used if possible. Additional JTS CPGs with ventilatory support\nconsiderations are Acute Respiratory Failur e and Wartime Thoracic Injury .\nINITIAL  VENTILATOR  SETTINGS\n*Prior to first use, ensure ventilator (as applicable) has been pre -set to utilize parameters of the user’s choice.  Some\nventilators may be preset to deliver an inspiration time (I -Time) instead of an I:E ratio. Some ventilators default to\nVolume or Press ure, which would need to be checked prior to use. Failure to appropriately set up and save these\nventilator settings may delay use of the ventilator.\n1. MODE : Assist Control (AC)  or Adaptive Support Ventilation (ASV) -Hamilton -T1 only\nEnsure the setting is either Volume or Pressure support. Some ventilators default to different settings.\n2. Breaths Per Minute /Respiratory Rate:  14BPM (10 -30 range)\n3. TIDAL VOLUME  (VT) : 6ml/kg IBW (4 -8ml/kg IBW range)\nQuick Reference: (Detailed reference in Appendix C )\nMale  Female\n66” = ~380cc [min: 255 / max: 510]  60” = ~273cc [min: 182 / max: 364]\n69” = ~420cc [min: 283 / max: 566]  63” = ~314cc [min: 210 / max: 419]\n72” = ~465cc [min: 310 / max: 621]  66” = ~356cc [min: 237 / max: 474]\n75” = ~505cc [min: 338 / max: 676]  69” = ~397cc [min: 265 / max: 530]  In patients with hemorrhagic shock\nrequiring intubation and mechanical\nventilation, remember the general\nprinciple of “resuscitation before\nintubation.” Utilize airway adjuncts if\nthe patient’s airway can be maintained\nadequately during initial resuscitation\nefforts with blood products.\nMechanical Ventilation Basics  CPG ID: 92\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5\n4. Fraction of Inspired Oxygenation ( FiO 2): 21 - 100% (0.21 -1.0) (low flow O2 @ 3 LPM (liters per minute) = ~ 40%\nFiO2 [flowrate on Saros oxygen concentrator])\n5. Inspiratory -to-Expiratory ( I:E) Ratio:  1:2\n6. Positive End -Expiratory Pressure ( PEEP ):  5 [Range 5 -20 cmH20]\n7. Pressure Support :  5 [Range 5 -20 cmH20] Consider adding if the patient has airway edema or is being ventilated\nthrough a narrower diameter ETT.\nI N I T I A L   S E T T I N G S\nNOTE :  Initial Ventilator settings are based on the patient's ideal body weight (IBW) and clinical condition.  However, “basic”\nor standard starting points are necessary to begin treatment.\n1. Set the ventilator to Volume Assist/Control. Consider pressure support if patient meets a clinical need.\n2. Set driving mechanics by type of ventilation.  Tidal Volume at 4 -6 mL/kg IBW (Average adult male is 500 mL).\n3. Set rate to maintain an appropriate minute ventilation (VE) of 4 -8 L/min (VT x Rate = VE).\n▪ For a MV of 6L and a VT of 500, set the rate at 12.\n▪ Continuous capnometry or capnography is the standard for invasive airway management and should be used\nto monitor ventilations and as a tool to increase or decrease frequency.  EtCO 2   is especially important for\nmonitoring TBI cases.\n▪ It is advisable to set the respiratory rate close to what the intrinsic rate was prior to sedation and or paralysis\nas that rate was likely compensating for some metabolic derangement and just reflexively setting it to a\n“normal rate” might precipitate wor sening acidosis.\n4. Set appropriate PEEP .  Minimum of 5 cmH2O.  Start there and titrate up as needed.  In hypoxic patients, consider\nstarting at 10 cmH2O  but take extreme caution if also hypotensive as PEEP may worsen BP .\n5. Set Fi02.  Depending on clinical condition the patient may need high Fi02.  Start at 100% and rapidly  titrate down\nto 40% using arterial blood gas and SpO2 data.  Do not rely on Sp02 alone (if possible).1\n6. Set Inspiratory: Expiratory Ratio (I:E) to 1:2 for most patients.  Adjust to clinical conditions.\n7. Oxygen requirements can be roughly calculated using Minute Ventilation x FiO2 fraction to determine LPM of pure\nO2 required (e.g., VE of 6 LPM @ 50% FiO2 (0.5) = 3 LPM bottled or generated O2 required.)\nNOTE :  Full D cylinder is ~425 liters O2 at 2200psi (i.e. ~141minutes O2 @ 3 LPM requirement above).  Calculations should\naccount for discrepancies in tank fill, leaks, dead space, etc. (consider a planning factor of 1.5 -2 X calculated requirement).\nRec o mmen d at io n\nIt is important to test ventilator settings prior to attaching to the patient. A recommendation is to have a test training  lung\nwith the equipment. An XL exam glove taped to the circuit is a field expedient test lung. This can ensure the ventilator is\nappropriately performing .\nASSESSMENT  AND THE INITIATION OF MECHA NICAL VENTILATION\nDetermining the need for mechanical ventilation is critical for the effective application of a mechanical ventilation device.\nMechanical ventilation has risks, especially in a prehospital environment without diagnostic  tools such as CXR or ABG.\nClinical acumen is vital to adequately predict a patient who will progress to respiratory compromise.  Respiratory\nMechanical Ventilation Basics  CPG ID: 92\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 compromise requiring ventilator support can be identified early in M -massive hemorrhage, A -airway, R -respiratory, C -\ncirculation, and H -hypothermia (MARCH) assessment.\nInability to adequately oxygenate, ventilate, or guard the airway are indications for mechanical ventilatory support – but\nthe cause must be determined.  Indications for intubation must be thoroughly considered as intubation and  Positive\nPressure Ventilation ( PPV) have risks.   For example, a patient with increased work of breathing due to hypoxia from\npneumothorax will be severely harmed by intubation with the introduction of positive pressure that can expand the\npneumothorax  and result in lethal tension p hysiology . Additionally , the bleeding patient who has a very high respiratory rate\ndue to global tissue hypoxemia from hemorrhagic shock  may have a full cardiovascular collapse with administration of\ninduction intubation medications  and positive pressure ventilation .  Thus, it is of utmost importance to ensur e that\nintubation and Mechanical Ventilation ( MV) are necessary and critical , with a plan for treating the most likely underlying\netiology in place .\nNOTE:  Apneic patients with adequate circulation and an open airway require immediate  assisted ventilation\n(i.e. bag valve mask [BVM]).\nThough ABGs are the standard for managing patients with respiratory compromise, they are not often readily available in\nthe operational environment.  Utilization of pulse oximetry (SpO 2) and capnography/capnometry ( EtCO 2) can provide a\nrapid assessment of a patient’s respiratory status (devices to achieve both are readily available in medical logistics system s).\nSpO 2 values < 90% are indicative of potential oxygenation issues; however, values can be unreliable due to poor perfusion\nand altitude.\nEtCO 2   values >45mmHg are indicative of hypoventilation, especially in the absence of tachypnea.  Values <35mmHg\nindicate  hyperventilation .  It should be determined why the patient is tachypneic and the underlying cause treated.    Mental\npreparation for mechanical respiratory support should be considered , but hypovolemia/hemorrhage must be treated first .\nOf note, EtCO 2   may not perfectly reflect the arterial CO 2 value in patients with significant lung injury and impaired gas\nexchange.2\nA high index of suspicion for sepsis or another cause of metabolic acidosis should be considered in patients with low\nEtCO 2  and hyperventilation.\nThe inability for a casualty to maintain appropriate SpO 2 or EtCO 2   values through less invasive measures (airway adjuncts,\nsupplemental O2, etc.) indicates the need for escalating support.  For locations with point of care blood analyzers,\ninadequate blood gas values also indicate the need for respiratory support.   Hemorrhagic shock will result in tachypnea and\na low EtCO 2 .  Intubation and mechanical ventilation prior to adequate blood resuscitation will result in circulatory collapse.\nIt is critical to determine why the patient is tachypneic  prior to intubation.  Ruling  out and treating both hemorrhage and\ntension  pneumothorax  (PTX) must occur before intubation.  Additionally, a simple PTX which could result in moderate\ntachypnea, positive pressure ventilation can rapidly convert a simple PTX into a tension PTX which is immediately life\nthreatening.\nWARNING :  Prior to the application of mechanical ventilation and/or initiation of invasive airway devices (e.g., Endotracheal\nTube (ETT), extraglottic airways), patients must receive adequate sedation (and paralysis as appropriate/required).  Never\nparalyze a patient who has not received sedation (in the prehospital environment, Ketamine should be first line for\nsedation)  Detailed guidelines for the initiation and maintenance of this sedation can be found in the JTS Analgesia and\nSedation Management during Prolonged Field Care  CPG.\nIf respiratory insufficiency amenable to respiratory support is identified during the assessment, the initiation of timely\nmechanical ventilation can improve casualty outcomes.  This can be as simple as BVM support or as complex as a critical\ncare transpor t ventilator (e.g. Hamilton -T1 or Zoll EMV+) , See Appendix D: Impact 754 , Appendix E: Zoll EMV+  (731\nSeries),  Appendix  F: Hamilton -T1, Appendix G: Save II , Appendix H: Ventway Sparrow . 3,4\nAll casualties requiring advanced airway management should have a Heat and Moisture Exchanger (HME) attached to the\nBVM or the circuit tubing. This aids in humidification, heat conservation, reduced infection risk, and comfort/compliance. If\nused with an EtCO 2   cap or device, the HME should be placed above the  EtCO 2  cap/device to enable more accurate\nEtCO 2  measurements .\nMechanical Ventilation Basics  CPG ID: 92\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 CAUTION :  BVM respiratory support should be utilized as a temporary measure until mechanical ventilators can be applied.\nBVMs deliver irregular tidal volume ( VT) and respiratory rates.\nAlthough PEEP is helpful in maximizing alveoli recruitment it can also contribute to worsening hypotension in hypovolemic\npatients and concomitant aggressive resuscitation.\nNOTE:   Many patients may require increased sedation (and paralysis) for effective ventilation.  Patients who are not properly\nsedated may cause issues with high pressure alarms as they breathe over the ventilator increasing their minute volume and\nintrathoracic  pressures.\nGastric decompression is also a necessary step after securing the definitive airway and initiation of mechanical ventilation.\nTROUBL ESHO OT ING\nA I R WAY   C O M P R O M I S E   O R   L O S T   A I R WAY\nIf at any time the patient begins to de -saturate or develop respiratory problems, immediately disconnect the ventilator,\nand manually ventilate the patient with BVM (with PEEP valve if available) and 100% O2 while correcting issues utilizing\nthe following D.O.P .E. algorithm.1\n▪ Displacement :  Verify that ETT is in place, patient not extubated/tube did not move during transfer.\n Check depth of the ETT by evaluating the numbers on the ETT.   To confirm it is in the trachea, you must\ndirectly visualize the ETT’s position using direct or video laryngoscopy.  If the ETT has advanced – pull back\nto original length and attempt to bag; if tube has pulled farther out of trachea, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO\nADVANCE the ETT without laryngoscopy or placement of bougie to verify tracheal placement.  When\nadvancing the bougie, f eel for tracheal rings or stop/ resistance at the carina.  If in doubt, remove  the\nendotracheal tube and attempt BVM.  If air movement is adequate, continue to bag ventilate the patient.\nUpon stabilization, consider alternative advanced airways (supraglottic airway or cricothyroidotomy).\n**If ETT moves freely, access for ETT bulb rupture via cuff manometer. 5\n▪ Obstructions :  Assess for secretions in ETT.  Suction if indicated.\n▪ Pressure :  Ensure that a tension pneumothorax / hemothorax has not developed (if the chest tube is in place,\nensure it is properly suctioning, not kinked or clamped).  If tension pneumothorax / hemothorax is suspected,\nperform immediate needle thoracentesis.  Auto  PEEPing or breath stacking can mirror development of a tension\npneumothorax (disconnect circuit and gently squeeze chest for full exhalation and adjust settings see below for\nfurther description). Assess the need for escharotomy if circumferential ly burned.  Consider additional paralysis\nand sedation if patient does not tolerate ventilation.5,6\n▪ Equipment : Ensure that ventilator did not fail; O2 tank not empty.  If ventilator is operational, trace all tubes to the\npatient connection (airway tube, transducer line, exhalation line) ensuring patency and connections. 1\n▪ Waveform Capnography : The utilization of concurrent waveform capnography may assist in determining the\ncausative issue while working the D.O.P .E mnemonic.\nAL A R M S\nHigh pressure alarms/Peak airway pressure alarms (Peak pressure >35 cm H2O):  Correct problems causing increased airway\nresistance and decreased lung compliance, including pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Check the ventilator to ensure\nthe prescribed tidal volume is being delivered.  Check for linked/crushed tubing.\nMechanical Ventilation Basics  CPG ID: 92\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 AI R  L E A K S\nAir leaks causing low pressure alarms/volume loss: ETT cuff malfunction/rupture is most commonly identified through loss\nof VT or audible leak. Assess, correct air leaks in endotracheal tube, tracheostomy cuff, ventilator system; recheck ventilator\nto make sure prescribed tidal volume is delivered.3\nV E N T I L AT O R   D Y S S Y N C H R O N Y\nVentilator dyssynchrony i s a clinical entity in which ventilator gas delivery and patient respiratory mechanics are not\nmatched.  Agitation and respiratory distress that develop in a patient on a mechanical ventilator who has previously\nappeared comfortable represents an important clinical circumstance that requires a thorough assessment and an organized\napproach.  The patient should not always be automatically re -sedated but  must instead be evaluated for several potentially\nlife-threatening developments that can present in this fashion.7\nLU N G  H Y P E R I N F L AT I O N\nLung hyperinflation (air trapping) and auto -PEEP:  Dynamic hyperinflation is associated with positive end -expiratory alveolar\npressure, or auto -PEEP .  The physiologic effects of air trapping include decreased cardiac preload because of diminished\nvenous re turn into the chest.  This can lead to hypotension and, if severe, to pulseless electrical activity and cardiac arrest.\nDynamic hyperinflation can also lead to local alveolar over -distention and rupture.  Prevent and manage lung hyperinflation\nby decreasi ng tidal volume, changing inspiratory and expiratory phase parameters, switching to another mode, and\ncorrecting physiological abnormalities that increase airway resistance.8,9  In an emergency, auto -PEEP from air trapping can\nbe relieved by simply disconnecting the circuit from the endotracheal tube for 3 -5 seconds, and then reconnecting.\nCHANGES  IN  RESPIRAT ORY  STATUS\n1. Assess patient’s prior interventions.\n2. Assess the following patient’s respiratory status:\n▪ Rate\n▪ Rhythm\n▪ Depth\n▪ Effort\n3.

Respiratory drive:   The normal respiratory rate is 12 -20 bpm.  Respiratory drive is controlled by central and\nperipheral receptors based on arterial concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2); oxygen (O 2), and hydrogen ions.\nIncreased intracranial pressure, administration of opioids and other medications may cause a central decrease in\nrespiratory drive. This could result in insufficient ventilation to maintain an adequate level of oxygenation and\ncleara nce of CO 2.1-3\n2. Work of breathing:   Work of breathing is the mechanical work needed to maintain oxygenation and ventilation.\nPain, acidosis, and hypermetabolic states will cause an increased work of breathing. This is not necessarily\npathologic but  does indicate additional respiratory support is needed while working up the underlying etiology.\nProlonged tachypnea, with etiology undiagnosed and untreated, can lead to inspiratory muscle fatigue which could\nrequire mechanical ventilator support (e.g., hemorrhagic shock, sev ere rib fractures, untreated asthma, etc.)  1-3\n3. Lung compliance:   Lung compliance is the ability of the lung to expand when given a certain amount of air\npressure.  The more compliant the lung, the less pressure needed for it to expand to a certain volume. Lungs with\nlow compliance will require higher pressures to expand  to the same volume as a normal lung. Internal causes such\nas pneumothorax and fluid/blood in the alveoli can decrease lung compliance. There are also external causes that\ndecrease lung’s ability to expand due to the stiffness of the ches t wall, such as obesity, pregnancy, burns, chest wall\ninjury .1-5 A decrease in lung compliance from any cause can lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.\n4. Tidal volume (TV or VT):   Is the volume of air that is exchanged in one breath. Decreases in tidal volume can result\nfrom external pressure (i.e. Pneumothorax, hemothorax, tension pneumothorax) by effectively reducing lung\nvolume. Dynamic hyperinflation also known as “breath stac king” is caused by the inability to completely exhale and\ncan lead to “auto -positive end expiratory pressure (auto -PEEP).”  This may be due to inadequate exhalation time,\nairflow obstruction, or both. This condition leads to decreas ing tidal volumes and can cause hemodynamic\ncompromise.1-3\n5. Oxygenation:   The successful binding of oxygen to hemoglobin at the cellular level in the alveoli, drives SaO2\n(arterial oxygen saturation) and SpO2 (oxygen saturation) values.  Successful alveolar gas exchange enables efficient\naerobic respiration at the cellular lev el in all perfused body tissues. 1-3\n6. Diffusion/exchange:   The process where oxygen (O2) is exchanged with CO 2 on red blood cells in the\nalveoli/pulmonary capillaries for transport to body tissues.  Pathologic conditions such as pulmonary edema,\npneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can impair diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar\nmembrane le ading to reduced oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. 1-3\n7. Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (F iO2):   Normal atmospheric air contains 21% oxygen or an F iO2 of 0.21. By increasing\nthe percentage of oxygen delivered to the patient (supplemental oxygen), you can potentially increase the arterial\noxygen saturation and oxygen content of the bloodstream. 1-3\n8. Dead Space:   Any part of the airway where gas exchange does not occur, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and\nventilator tubing are examples.\n9. Hypoxia:   A state of O2 deficiency in the tissue significant enough to cause impairment of function.  Causes can be\nmultifactorial to include low P aO2 due to elevation/altitude(>10,000 feet), decreased available RBCs such as\nhemorrhage or decreased RBC functionality such as CO poisoning, inadequate circulation or perfusion such as G\nforce pooling or hypotension causes without RBC deficits, and decreas ed tissue level oxygen transport such as in\ncyanide poisoning. 1-3\nMechanical Ventilation Basics\nCPG ID: 92\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  15 V E N T I L AT I O N   D e f i n i t i o n s\n1. Minute ventilation (VE) :  Tidal volume multiplied by the respiratory rate (normal is 60cc/kg/min), usually expressed\nin liters (8 -10L.min).  The body regulates carbon dioxide through changes in minute ventilation.  Increases in carbon\ndioxide leads to increased respiratory rate and/or tidal volume and increased minute ventilation (amount of air\nexchanged during one minute of ventilation). 1-3\n2. Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) :  The greatest pressure within the lungs during inspiration.  Pressures above\n35mmHg have been shown to cause pressure -related lung injury (barotrauma).  Ideally, pressures should remain\nbelow 30 mmHg.  Increased peak pressures are usually due to increase s in resistance or decreased lung compliance\nwithin the respiratory system (e.g., kink in the circuit, mucous plugging, laryngospasm/bronchospasm, tension\npneumothorax, inability for adequate exhalation, edema). 1-3\n3. Plateau pressure : It is the static pressure achieved at the end of a full inspiration. To measure plateau pressure, we\nneed to perform an inspiratory hold on the ventilator to permit the pressure to equalize through the system.\nPlateau pressure is a measure of alveolar pr essure and lung compliance. Normal plateau pressure is below 30 cm\nH20, and higher pressure can generate barotrauma. Checking a plateau pressure is helpful to delineate between a\nresistance or compliance problem.  If peak pressures are high  and plateau pressures are normal, this is indicative of\na resistance problem (kinked circuit, ventilator asynchrony, laryngospasm, mucous plugging, etc.).  If peak and\nplateau pressure are high, this is more likely from compliance issues such as pneumonia , pulmonary edema,\natelectasis, pneumothorax, abdominal compartment syndrome, etc.).\n4. End Tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2  ):  Measurement of carbon dioxide on end tidal expiration.  Normal values are 35mmHg -\n45mmHg.  Exhaled gasses are analyzed by either vital signs monitor or portable EtCO 2   devices (e.g., EMMA) a\nquantitative capnograph or capnometer is the clinical standard of care with invasively ventilated patients.  EtCO 2   is\none of the most useful measures to determine overall adequacy of ventilation.  Anyone who is intubating a patient\nand putting them on mechanical ventilation must be able to monitor EtCO 2  .\n5. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) :  Although continuous pulse oximetry and EtCO 2   can reliably confirm adequate\noxygenation, ventilation, and guide most ventilator changes – ABGs are the gold standard for evaluating acid -base\nstatus, oxygenation, ventilation and adjusting ventilation settings.  If a point of care blood gas analyzer is available,\nthis can enable targeted ventilator setting  changes .  Knowing these values will greatly improve critical care\nguidance via telemedicine resources.  At facility -based  care (Role 2 care and beyond) an arterial line for continuous\nblood pressure monitoring and ABG sampling should be placed .\n6. Normal ABG values:\n▪ pH (7.35 -7.45)\n▪ PaO 2 (75-100 mmHg)\n▪ PaCO 2 (35-45 mmHg)\n▪ HCO3 (22 -26 meq/L)\n▪ Base excess/deficit ( -2 to +2)\n▪ SaO2 (95 -100%)\nA B G   D E F I N I T I O N S\nWhile in the PH and rotary wing transport environments, it is rare to obtain an ABG – knowing the normal values is\nimportant to check a patient prior to Role 2 to Role 3 RW transport.  The ABG is extremely useful in trauma resuscitations\nbecause the pH, la ctate and base deficit will give an overall picture of perfusion.\n1. pH:  Measure of hydrogen ion concentration (i.e. acid -base status).  Acidosis (low pH) leads to\ncoagulopathic states in trauma patients as well as development of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias.\n2. PaO 2:  Measurement of dissolved oxygen in blood, also a measurement of adequacy of gas exchange at\nthe cellular level.\nMechanical Ventilation Basics\nCPG ID: 92\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  16 3. PaCO 2:  Measurement of dissolved carbon dioxide in blood, also a measurement of adequacy of gas\nexchange at the cellular level.\n4. HCO3 :  Measurement of bicarbonate in the blood, serves as a buffer against acid.\n5. Base excess :  Gives indication of metabolic component of blood gas results, most likely will not change\nfield ventilator management but can provide information for telemedicine consultation regarding\nadequacy of resuscitation.\n6. SaO 2:  Percentage of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in arterial blood, correlates closely with SpO2 values.\nV E N T I L AT O R   T E R M S\n1. Volume -targeted modes :  Volume constant, inspiration terminates when preset VT delivered.  Peak\nairway pressure is variable and increases as needed to deliver prescribed VT.  This is generally\nrepresented by a constant flow waveform.\n2. Pressure -targeted modes :  Volume variable and dependent on pulmonary compliance.  The vent\nterminates flow of air when the pressure is met.  Peak airway pressure is fixed, determined by set\npressure level.  This is generally represented by a decelerating flow waveform.\n3. Tidal volume (VT):  Is the volume of gas, exchanged during a breath and commonly expressed in\nmilliliters. VT is generally set between 4 -8 ml/kg ideal body weight (IBW), to prevent lung over distension\nand barotrauma.\n4. Frequency (f) :  Is the rate, per minute, of breathing (patient or ventilator).  Known as respiratory rate\n(RR).\n5. Minute Ventilation (Ve) :  Is the average volume of gas entering, or leaving, the lungs per minute,\ncommonly expressed in liters per minute.  The product of VT and RR (respiratory rate).  Normal Ve is 5 –\n10 L/min.\n6. Inspiratory (I) and Expiratory (E) time and I:E ratio :  Is the period of time over which the VT is delivered.\nSetting a shorter inspiratory time (I) results in a faster inspiratory flow rate in volume cycled ventilation.\nAverage adult inspiratory time is 0.7 to 1 second. I:E ratio is usually 1:2.\n7. Positive end -expiratory pressure (PEEP) :  Is the amount of positive pressure that is maintained at end -\nexpiration.  It is expressed in centimeters of water (cmH2O).  The purpose of PEEP is to increase end -\nexpiratory lung volume and reduce air -space closure at end -expiration.  Normal physiologic PEEP is 5\ncmH2O.\n8. Pressure Support (PS) :  Delivers flow at a set pressure, generally to overcome resistance of the airway\nand ventilator circuit.  PS can also be used to support a spontaneously breathing patient, such as with Bi -\nPAP .\n9. Flow :  Is the velocity at which gas is delivered to the patient, expressed in liters per minute.  When the\nflow rate is set higher, the speed of gas delivery is faster and inspiratory time is shorter.\n10. Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) :  Represents the total pressure that is required to deliver the VT and\ndepends upon various airway resistance, lung compliance, and chest wall factors.  It is expressed in\ncentimeters of water (cmH2O).\n11. Sensitivity or trigger sensitivity :  Effort, or negative pressure, required by the patient to trigger a\nmachine breath, commonly set so that minimal effort ( -1 to -2 cmH2O) is required to trigger a breath.1,3\nMechanical Ventilation Basics\nCPG ID: 92\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  17 R E F E R E N C E S\n1.

The patient can take their own breaths in addition to mandatory\nbreaths, with each spontaneous breath receiving the full preset tidal volume (assist part).  Airway pressures can\nvary during delivery. 1-3\n▪ Volume Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (V -SIMV) combines mandatory breaths and supported\nbreaths. “synchronized” means it will adjust the delivery of breaths with the patient’s effort. “Intermittent” means\nthat not all breaths are supported.  The ventilator delivers a preset number of mandatory breaths per minute.  Any\nbreath taken over the set RR will not receive the set tidal volume and is solely based on the patient’s lung\ncompliance and effort. Newer models offer PS with patient triggere d breaths.\nPressure -targeted Modes\n▪ Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)  supports every patient breath with a preset amount of pressure support.  No\nmandatory breaths are given, so the patient must be spontaneously breathing.\n▪ Pressure Assist control (P -AC), or Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV)  delivers a set number of mandatory pressure -\ncontrolled breaths, in which the patient receives a fixed pressure during a preset inspiratory time.  Any breaths over\nthe set rate will be pressure controlled with the same amount of pressure.  The delivered ti dal volume will be\nbased on the amount of pressure applied, the lung compliance and airway resistance of the patient.\nAdaptive Support Ventilation (ASV)\nASV provides intelligent ventilation mode that continuously adjusts respiratory rate, tidal volume, and inspiratory time\ndepending on the patient’s lung mechanics and effort.  This is similar to “Auto -Flow” or other like settings on different\nbrands of ventilators. Currently only available on the Hamilton -T1.\nContinuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)\nCPAP Is a type of positive airway pressure, where the air flow is introduced into the airways to maintain a continuous\npressure to constantly stent the airways open, in people who are breathing spontaneously.1  CPAP provides constant\npressure above that of the atmospheric pressure. Delivered via the upper respiratory tract.\nPressure Regulated Volume Control (PRVC) Ventilation\nPRVC ventilation is designed for invasive mechanical ventilation and combines volume and pressure strategies. PRVC delivers\na pressure -controlled and tidal volume (VT) –targeted breath using a decelerating flow waveform pattern that allows\nunrestricted spon taneous breathing with or without pressure support (PS). 2 (may be Impact 731 only). ***  VENTILATOR MODES\nAPRV\nAir Pressure\nRelease\nVentilation  The same as DuoPAP but\nwith an inverse I:E ratio.\nExpiratory/release time too\nshort to return to FRC.\nThigh sets RR\nTlow sets TV  As for DuoPAP\nInverse ratios\nincrease mean\nairway pressure and\nmany increase lung\nrecruitment\nImproves\noxygenation.

VT is generally set between 4 -8ml/kg\nIBW, to prevent lung over distension and barotrauma.4-8\nIdeal IBW\nThe weight at which tidal volume is calculated against instead of using actual weight.  This enables patients to be ventilate d\nin a lung -protective strategy.  A quick reference chart can be found in Appendix C .  IBW can be calculated manually as\nfollows:\n▪ Male: {(Height in inches -60) x 2.2} +50 (e.g. 72in -60= 12; 12 x 2.2 = 26.4; 26.4 + 50 = IBW of 76.4 kg)\n▪ Female: {(Height in inches -60) x 2.2} +45 (e.g. 65in -60= 5; 5 x 2.2 = 11; 11 + 45 = IBW of 56 kg)\nMinute Ventilation (VE)\nThe average volume of gas entering, or leaving, the lungs per minute, commonly expressed in liters per minute.  Also called\nminute volume.  Minute ventilation is the product of VT and RR (respiratory rate).  Normal VE is 5 – 10 L/min. 4-8\nI:E Ratio\nSee I:E definition.  I:E might need to be adjusted for physiology that requires extended exhalation time. 4-8    For example:\nAsthma patient may require an I:E of 1:3, 1:4, or 1:5 to allow for more exhalation time.\nFlow Rate\nIs the velocity at which gas is delivered to the patient, expressed in liters per minute.  When the flow rate is set higher, the\nspeed of gas delivery is faster and inspiratory time is shorter. 4-8\nPeak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP)\nRepresents the total pressure that is required to deliver the VT and depends upon various airway resistance, lung\ncompliance, and chest wall factors.  It is expressed in centimeters of water (cm H2O).\nSensitivity or trigger sensitivity\nTrigger sensitivity Is the effort, or negative pressure, required by the patient to trigger a machine breath, commonly set so\nthat minimal effort ( -1 to -2 cm H2O) triggers a breath.1,3  This is usually seen with assist modes of ventilator operation.\nPressure alarms\nPressure alarms ensure that providers are alerted to pressures that fall outside of appropriate ranges and have potential to\nharm the patient via barotrauma (over -pressure) or under -ventilation (circuit disconnect or under -pressure).  Pressures will\nbe determined by placing the patient on the vent for ~1 -2 minutes  and determining intrinsic peak inspiratory pressure.\n(Labeled as PEAK on 754 Ventilator (top right); Labeled as peak on Hamilton T1 ventilator (top left); Labeled as PIP on ZOLL\nEMV+ (731) (right center).  Standard alarm settings should be: Need to measur e a peak pressure 5 min after setting initial\nsettings.\n▪ High pressure alarm: 10 cmH2O above peak airway pressure.\n▪ Low pressure alarm: 5 cmH2O below peak airway pressure.\nMechanical Ventilation Basics\nCPG ID: 92\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  21 R e f e r e n c e s\n1.

This applies to off -label uses with patients who\nare armed f orces members.\nBACKGROUND\nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of FDA -approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are usually\nnot subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved\ndrugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part\nof clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved\nuses may also be subject to speci al regulations.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS\nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it does not\nimply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard\nof care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care\npractitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for t he\nclinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship.\nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES\nBalanced Discussion\nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by the FDA.\nFurther, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that\nsugge st caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA -issued warnings.\nQuality Assurance Monitoring\nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring of\noutcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.\nInformation to Patients\nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an unusual off -\nlabel use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be given to including in an\nappendix  an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product.\nInformation to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a\nDoD health care practitio ner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with\nsuch use."

Ventilator management is resource intensive and demanding \nwhich might not make it appropriate for all tactical situations. If a patient is maintaining their airway and has appropriate \noxygenation and ventilation, they should not be intubated by prehospital providers for transport from point of injury \n(POI) to the first battlefi eld role of care.  \nIntubation and providing mechanical ventilation are not without risk.  \nThe benefits should outweigh the attributable cost and risk of \nmanaging the mechanically ventilated patient, especially within the \naustere/ battlefield setting.  Pathology associated with failure to \noxygenate and failure to ventilate wi ll most often require definitive \nairway interventions and appropriate mechanical ventilator support.  \nAt times, it may only serve as a temporizing measure while seeking \ndefinitive critical care. Initiation  of mechanical ventilation must be \nguided by clinical suspicion of underlying pathophysiology and clear \ncriteria.  A definitive airway is  required for effective mechanical \nventilation  and these patients require sedation – both mechanical ventilation and sedation may  make a hypotensive patient \nmore hypotensive and could result in hemodynamic instability.  Thoughtful consideration for the requirement of  mechanical \nventilation must occur .  See the JTS Airway Management of Traumatic Injuries and Analgesia and Sedation Management \nduring Prolonged Field Care  CPG. In patients with hemorrhagic shock requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, \nremember the general principle of “resuscitation before intubation .” Utilize airway adjuncts i f the patient ’s airway can be \nmaintained adequately during initial resuscitation efforts with blood products. In an under -resuscitated patient, cardiac \narrest can occur when induction and paralytic medications are given during rapid sequence intubation.  \nThe intent of this CPG is to provide the non -critical care trained  medical personnel with guidance on basic ventilator \nmanagement .  Expanded information on definitions, ventilator terms and modes can be found in Appendix A and B.  In the \nprolonged care setting, telemedicine  consultation should be used if possible. Additional JTS CPGs with ventilatory support \nconsiderations are Acute Respiratory Failur e and Wartime Thoracic Injury . \nINITIAL  VENTILATOR  SETTINGS  \n*Prior to first use, ensure ventilator (as applicable) has been pre -set to utilize parameters of the user’s choice.  Some \nventilators may be preset to deliver an inspiration time (I -Time) instead of an I:E ratio. Some ventilators default to \nVolume or Press ure, which would need to be checked prior to use. Failure to appropriately set up and save these \nventilator settings may delay use of the ventilator.  \n1. MODE : Assist Control (AC)  or Adaptive Support Ventilation (ASV) -Hamilton -T1 only  \nEnsure the setting is either Volume or Pressure support. Some ventilators default to different settings.  \n2. Breaths Per Minute /Respiratory Rate:  14BPM (10 -30 range)  \n3. TIDAL VOLUME  (VT) : 6ml/kg IBW (4 -8ml/kg IBW range)  \nQuick Reference: (Detailed reference in Appendix C ) \nMale  Female  \n66” = ~380cc [min: 255 / max: 510]  60” = ~273cc [min: 182 / max: 364]  \n69” = ~420cc [min: 283 / max: 566]  63” = ~314cc [min: 210 / max: 419]  \n72” = ~465cc [min: 310 / max: 621]  66” = ~356cc [min: 237 / max: 474]  \n75” = ~505cc [min: 338 / max: 676]  69” = ~397cc [min: 265 / max: 530]  In patients with hemorrhagic shock \nrequiring intubation and mechanical \nventilation, remember the general \nprinciple of “resuscitation before \nintubation.” Utilize airway adjuncts if \nthe patient’s airway can be maintained \nadequately during initial resuscitation \nefforts with blood products.  \nMechanical Ventilation Basics  CPG ID: 92 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5  \n4. Fraction of Inspired Oxygenation ( FiO 2): 21 - 100% (0.21 -1.0) (low flow O2 @ 3 LPM (liters per minute) = ~ 40% \nFiO2 [flowrate on Saros oxygen concentrator])  \n5. Inspiratory -to-Expiratory ( I:E) Ratio:  1:2  \n6. Positive End -Expiratory Pressure ( PEEP ):  5 [Range 5 -20 cmH20]  \n7. Pressure Support :  5 [Range 5 -20 cmH20] Consider adding if the patient has airway edema or is being ventilated \nthrough a narrower diameter ETT.  \nI N I T I A L   S E T T I N G S  \nNOTE :  Initial Ventilator settings are based on the patient's ideal body weight (IBW) and clinical condition.  However, “basic” \nor standard starting points are necessary to begin treatment.  \n1. Set the ventilator to Volume Assist/Control. Consider pressure support if patient meets a clinical need.  \n2. Set driving mechanics by type of ventilation.  Tidal Volume at 4 -6 mL/kg IBW (Average adult male is 500 mL).  \n3. Set rate to maintain an appropriate minute ventilation (VE) of 4 -8 L/min (VT x Rate = VE).  \n▪ For a MV of 6L and a VT of 500, set the rate at 12.  \n▪ Continuous capnometry or capnography is the standard for invasive airway management and should be used \nto monitor ventilations and as a tool to increase or decrease frequency.  EtCO 2   is especially important for \nmonitoring TBI cases.  \n▪ It is advisable to set the respiratory rate close to what the intrinsic rate was prior to sedation and or paralysis \nas that rate was likely compensating for some metabolic derangement and just reflexively setting it to a \n“normal rate” might precipitate wor sening acidosis.  \n4. Set appropriate PEEP .  Minimum of 5 cmH2O.  Start there and titrate up as needed.  In hypoxic patients, consider \nstarting at 10 cmH2O  but take extreme caution if also hypotensive as PEEP may worsen BP .  \n5. Set Fi02.  Depending on clinical condition the patient may need high Fi02.  Start at 100% and rapidly  titrate down \nto 40% using arterial blood gas and SpO2 data.  Do not rely on Sp02 alone (if possible).1 \n6. Set Inspiratory: Expiratory Ratio (I:E) to 1:2 for most patients.  Adjust to clinical conditions.  \n7. Oxygen requirements can be roughly calculated using Minute Ventilation x FiO2 fraction to determine LPM of pure \nO2 required (e.g., VE of 6 LPM @ 50% FiO2 (0.5) = 3 LPM bottled or generated O2 required.)  \nNOTE :  Full D cylinder is ~425 liters O2 at 2200psi (i.e. ~141minutes O2 @ 3 LPM requirement above).  Calculations should \naccount for discrepancies in tank fill, leaks, dead space, etc. (consider a planning factor of 1.5 -2 X calculated requirement).   \nRec o mmen d at io n  \nIt is important to test ventilator settings prior to attaching to the patient. A recommendation is to have a test training  lung \nwith the equipment. An XL exam glove taped to the circuit is a field expedient test lung. This can ensure the ventilator is \nappropriately performing . \nASSESSMENT  AND THE INITIATION OF MECHA NICAL VENTILATION  \nDetermining the need for mechanical ventilation is critical for the effective application of a mechanical ventilation device.   \nMechanical ventilation has risks, especially in a prehospital environment without diagnostic  tools such as CXR or ABG.  \nClinical acumen is vital to adequately predict a patient who will progress to respiratory compromise.  Respiratory \nMechanical Ventilation Basics  CPG ID: 92 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 compromise requiring ventilator support can be identified early in M -massive hemorrhage, A -airway, R -respiratory, C -\ncirculation, and H -hypothermia (MARCH) assessment.   \nInability to adequately oxygenate, ventilate, or guard the airway are indications for mechanical ventilatory support – but \nthe cause must be determined.  Indications for intubation must be thoroughly considered as intubation and  Positive \nPressure Ventilation ( PPV) have risks.   For example, a patient with increased work of breathing due to hypoxia from \npneumothorax will be severely harmed by intubation with the introduction of positive pressure that can expand the \npneumothorax  and result in lethal tension p hysiology . Additionally , the bleeding patient who has a very high respiratory rate  \ndue to global tissue hypoxemia from hemorrhagic shock  may have a full cardiovascular collapse with administration of \ninduction intubation medications  and positive pressure ventilation .  Thus, it is of utmost importance to ensur e that \nintubation and Mechanical Ventilation ( MV) are necessary and critical , with a plan for treating the most likely underlying \netiology in place .     \nNOTE:  Apneic patients with adequate circulation and an open airway require immediate  assisted ventilation   \n(i.e. bag valve mask [BVM]).  \nThough ABGs are the standard for managing patients with respiratory compromise, they are not often readily available in \nthe operational environment.  Utilization of pulse oximetry (SpO 2) and capnography/capnometry ( EtCO 2) can provide a \nrapid assessment of a patient’s respiratory status (devices to achieve both are readily available in medical logistics system s).  \nSpO 2 values < 90% are indicative of potential oxygenation issues; however, values can be unreliable due to poor perfusion \nand altitude.  \nEtCO 2   values >45mmHg are indicative of hypoventilation, especially in the absence of tachypnea.  Values <35mmHg \nindicate  hyperventilation .  It should be determined why the patient is tachypneic and the underlying cause treated.    Mental \npreparation for mechanical respiratory support should be considered , but hypovolemia/hemorrhage must be treated first . \nOf note, EtCO 2   may not perfectly reflect the arterial CO 2 value in patients with significant lung injury and impaired gas \nexchange.2 \nA high index of suspicion for sepsis or another cause of metabolic acidosis should be considered in patients with low \nEtCO 2  and hyperventilation.  \nThe inability for a casualty to maintain appropriate SpO 2 or EtCO 2   values through less invasive measures (airway adjuncts, \nsupplemental O2, etc.) indicates the need for escalating support.  For locations with point of care blood analyzers, \ninadequate blood gas values also indicate the need for respiratory support.   Hemorrhagic shock will result in tachypnea and \na low EtCO 2 .  Intubation and mechanical ventilation prior to adequate blood resuscitation will result in circulatory collapse. \nIt is critical to determine why the patient is tachypneic  prior to intubation.  Ruling  out and treating both hemorrhage and \ntension  pneumothorax  (PTX) must occur before intubation.  Additionally, a simple PTX which could result in moderate \ntachypnea, positive pressure ventilation can rapidly convert a simple PTX into a tension PTX which is immediately life \nthreatening.  \nWARNING :  Prior to the application of mechanical ventilation and/or initiation of invasive airway devices (e.g., Endotracheal \nTube (ETT), extraglottic airways), patients must receive adequate sedation (and paralysis as appropriate/required).  Never \nparalyze a patient who has not received sedation (in the prehospital environment, Ketamine should be first line for \nsedation)  Detailed guidelines for the initiation and maintenance of this sedation can be found in the JTS Analgesia and \nSedation Management during Prolonged Field Care  CPG. \nIf respiratory insufficiency amenable to respiratory support is identified during the assessment, the initiation of timely \nmechanical ventilation can improve casualty outcomes.  This can be as simple as BVM support or as complex as a critical \ncare transpor t ventilator (e.g. Hamilton -T1 or Zoll EMV+) , See Appendix D: Impact 754 , Appendix E: Zoll EMV+  (731  \nSeries),  Appendix  F: Hamilton -T1, Appendix G: Save II , Appendix H: Ventway Sparrow . 3,4   \nAll casualties requiring advanced airway management should have a Heat and Moisture Exchanger (HME) attached to the \nBVM or the circuit tubing. This aids in humidification, heat conservation, reduced infection risk, and comfort/compliance. If  \nused with an EtCO 2   cap or device, the HME should be placed above the  EtCO 2  cap/device to enable more accurate \nEtCO 2  measurements .   \nMechanical Ventilation Basics  CPG ID: 92 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 CAUTION :  BVM respiratory support should be utilized as a temporary measure until mechanical ventilators can be applied.  \nBVMs deliver irregular tidal volume ( VT) and respiratory rates.  \nAlthough PEEP is helpful in maximizing alveoli recruitment it can also contribute to worsening hypotension in hypovolemic \npatients and concomitant aggressive resuscitation.  \nNOTE:   Many patients may require increased sedation (and paralysis) for effective ventilation.  Patients who are not properly \nsedated may cause issues with high pressure alarms as they breathe over the ventilator increasing their minute volume and \nintrathoracic  pressures.   \nGastric decompression is also a necessary step after securing the definitive airway and initiation of mechanical ventilation.   \nTROUBL ESHO OT ING  \nA I R WAY   C O M P R O M I S E   O R   L O S T   A I R WAY  \nIf at any time the patient begins to de -saturate or develop respiratory problems, immediately disconnect the ventilator, \nand manually ventilate the patient with BVM (with PEEP valve if available) and 100% O2 while correcting issues utilizing \nthe following D.O.P .E. algorithm.1    \n▪ Displacement :  Verify that ETT is in place, patient not extubated/tube did not move during transfer.  \n Check depth of the ETT by evaluating the numbers on the ETT.   To confirm it is in the trachea, you must \ndirectly visualize the ETT’s position using direct or video laryngoscopy.  If the ETT has advanced – pull back \nto original length and attempt to bag; if tube has pulled farther out of trachea, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO \nADVANCE the ETT without laryngoscopy or placement of bougie to verify tracheal placement.  When \nadvancing the bougie, f eel for tracheal rings or stop/ resistance at the carina.  If in doubt, remove  the \nendotracheal tube and attempt BVM.  If air movement is adequate, continue to bag ventilate the patient.  \nUpon stabilization, consider alternative advanced airways (supraglottic airway or cricothyroidotomy).  \n**If ETT moves freely, access for ETT bulb rupture via cuff manometer. 5 \n▪ Obstructions :  Assess for secretions in ETT.  Suction if indicated.  \n▪ Pressure :  Ensure that a tension pneumothorax / hemothorax has not developed (if the chest tube is in place, \nensure it is properly suctioning, not kinked or clamped).  If tension pneumothorax / hemothorax is suspected, \nperform immediate needle thoracentesis.  Auto  PEEPing or breath stacking can mirror development of a tension \npneumothorax (disconnect circuit and gently squeeze chest for full exhalation and adjust settings see below for \nfurther description). Assess the need for escharotomy if circumferential ly burned.  Consider additional paralysis \nand sedation if patient does not tolerate ventilation.5,6  \n▪ Equipment : Ensure that ventilator did not fail; O2 tank not empty.  If ventilator is operational, trace all tubes to the \npatient connection (airway tube, transducer line, exhalation line) ensuring patency and connections. 1 \n▪ Waveform Capnography : The utilization of concurrent waveform capnography may assist in determining the \ncausative issue while working the D.O.P .E mnemonic.  \nAL A R M S  \nHigh pressure alarms/Peak airway pressure alarms (Peak pressure >35 cm H2O):  Correct problems causing increased airway \nresistance and decreased lung compliance, including pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Check the ventilator to ensure \nthe prescribed tidal volume is being delivered.  Check for linked/crushed tubing.  \n \n \nMechanical Ventilation Basics  CPG ID: 92 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 AI R  L E A K S  \nAir leaks causing low pressure alarms/volume loss: ETT cuff malfunction/rupture is most commonly identified through loss \nof VT or audible leak. Assess, correct air leaks in endotracheal tube, tracheostomy cuff, ventilator system; recheck ventilator \nto make sure prescribed tidal volume is delivered.3 \n \nV E N T I L AT O R   D Y S S Y N C H R O N Y  \nVentilator dyssynchrony i s a clinical entity in which ventilator gas delivery and patient respiratory mechanics are not \nmatched.  Agitation and respiratory distress that develop in a patient on a mechanical ventilator who has previously \nappeared comfortable represents an important clinical circumstance that requires a thorough assessment and an organized \napproach.  The patient should not always be automatically re -sedated but  must instead be evaluated for several potentially \nlife-threatening developments that can present in this fashion.7 \nLU N G  H Y P E R I N F L AT I O N  \nLung hyperinflation (air trapping) and auto -PEEP:  Dynamic hyperinflation is associated with positive end -expiratory alveolar \npressure, or auto -PEEP .  The physiologic effects of air trapping include decreased cardiac preload because of diminished \nvenous re turn into the chest.  This can lead to hypotension and, if severe, to pulseless electrical activity and cardiac arrest.  \nDynamic hyperinflation can also lead to local alveolar over -distention and rupture.  Prevent and manage lung hyperinflation \nby decreasi ng tidal volume, changing inspiratory and expiratory phase parameters, switching to another mode, and \ncorrecting physiological abnormalities that increase airway resistance.8,9  In an emergency, auto -PEEP from air trapping can \nbe relieved by simply disconnecting the circuit from the endotracheal tube for 3 -5 seconds, and then reconnecting.   \nCHANGES  IN  RESPIRAT ORY  STATUS  \n1. Assess patient’s prior interventions.  \n2. Assess the following patient’s respiratory status:  \n▪ Rate  \n▪ Rhythm  \n▪ Depth  \n▪ Effort  \n3. Assess monitors:  \n▪ Oxygenation (SpO2)  \n▪ EtCO 2   (with advanced airway or EMMA mounted on non -rebreather mask)  \n▪ Cardiac monitoring if available  \n4. Determine cause of ventilation issue and/or ventilator alarm using DOPE mnemonic.  \nMechanical Ventilation Basics     CPG ID: 92 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment      9 Table 1.  Trouble shooting – DOPE Algorithm  \nAlarm  DOPE  Possible Cause  Troubleshooting  \nHigh Pressure  D Mainstem intubation  If the tube has advanced and unilateral ventilation is confirmed, retract the tube to proper depth using \nbougie technique to maintain placement.  \nHigh Pressure  D Esophageal \nintubation  If the tube is advanced and unilateral ventilation is not present, rule out esophageal intubation  – evaluat e \nwith DL or VL .  If breath sounds are present over abdomen, or gastric distention noted, remove the ET tube \nand secure airway by other means and place gastric tube for evacuation of gastric contents.   \nHigh Pressure  O Obstruction of ET \ntube  Place patient on FiO 2 1.0 (100%) and prepare suction equipment. Suction airway using standard technique. If \ninhalation injury is suspected (burn, agent), saline may be used to facilitate suctioning.  \nHigh Pressure  O/E Obstruction of \nventilator circuit  Ensure circuit connections are attached and not kinked paying particular attention to connections and sharp \nbends.  \nHigh Pressure  P Pulmonary circuit  Rule out/treat hemothorax / pneumothorax.  \nHigh Pressure  P Pulmonary circuit  Consider Pulmonary Edema. Prolong Inspiratory time if appropriate (i.e. adjust from 1:3 to 1:2 to 1:1).  \nHigh Pressure  P Pulmonary circuit  Consider airway swelling; may need to add or increase Pressure Support  \nHigh Pressure  P Pulmonary circuit  Evaluate Tidal Volume. Consider lowering by 1cc/kg (min. 4cc/kg).  \nHigh Pressure  P Patient arousal  Address analgesia/sedation needs.  \nHigh Pressure  P Stacked breath/air \ntrapping  Disconnect patient from the circuit and allow full exhale.

Respiratory drive:   The normal respiratory rate is 12 -20 bpm.  Respiratory drive is controlled by central and \nperipheral receptors based on arterial concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2); oxygen (O 2), and hydrogen ions.  \nIncreased intracranial pressure, administration of opioids and other medications may cause a central decrease in \nrespiratory drive. This could result in insufficient ventilation to maintain an adequate level of oxygenation and \ncleara nce of CO 2.1-3 \n2. Work of breathing:   Work of breathing is the mechanical work needed to maintain oxygenation and ventilation.  \nPain, acidosis, and hypermetabolic states will cause an increased work of breathing. This is not necessarily \npathologic but  does indicate additional respiratory support is needed while working up the underlying etiology.   \nProlonged tachypnea, with etiology undiagnosed and untreated, can lead to inspiratory muscle fatigue which could \nrequire mechanical ventilator support (e.g., hemorrhagic shock, sev ere rib fractures, untreated asthma, etc.)  1-3 \n3. Lung compliance:   Lung compliance is the ability of the lung to expand when given a certain amount of air \npressure.  The more compliant the lung, the less pressure needed for it to expand to a certain volume. Lungs with \nlow compliance will require higher pressures to expand  to the same volume as a normal lung. Internal causes such \nas pneumothorax and fluid/blood in the alveoli can decrease lung compliance. There are also external causes that \ndecrease lung’s ability to expand due to the stiffness of the ches t wall, such as obesity, pregnancy, burns, chest wall \ninjury .1-5 A decrease in lung compliance from any cause can lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.   \n4. Tidal volume (TV or VT):   Is the volume of air that is exchanged in one breath. Decreases in tidal volume can result \nfrom external pressure (i.e. Pneumothorax, hemothorax, tension pneumothorax) by effectively reducing lung \nvolume. Dynamic hyperinflation also known as “breath stac king” is caused by the inability to completely exhale and \ncan lead to “auto -positive end expiratory pressure (auto -PEEP).”  This may be due to inadequate exhalation time, \nairflow obstruction, or both. This condition leads to decreas ing tidal volumes and can cause hemodynamic \ncompromise.1-3   \n5. Oxygenation:   The successful binding of oxygen to hemoglobin at the cellular level in the alveoli, drives SaO2 \n(arterial oxygen saturation) and SpO2 (oxygen saturation) values.  Successful alveolar gas exchange enables efficient \naerobic respiration at the cellular lev el in all perfused body tissues. 1-3 \n6. Diffusion/exchange:   The process where oxygen (O2) is exchanged with CO 2 on red blood cells in the \nalveoli/pulmonary capillaries for transport to body tissues.  Pathologic conditions such as pulmonary edema, \npneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can impair diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar \nmembrane le ading to reduced oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. 1-3 \n7. Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (F iO2):   Normal atmospheric air contains 21% oxygen or an F iO2 of 0.21. By increasing \nthe percentage of oxygen delivered to the patient (supplemental oxygen), you can potentially increase the arterial \noxygen saturation and oxygen content of the bloodstream. 1-3 \n8. Dead Space:   Any part of the airway where gas exchange does not occur, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and \nventilator tubing are examples.  \n9. Hypoxia:   A state of O2 deficiency in the tissue significant enough to cause impairment of function.  Causes can be \nmultifactorial to include low P aO2 due to elevation/altitude(>10,000 feet), decreased available RBCs such as \nhemorrhage or decreased RBC functionality such as CO poisoning, inadequate circulation or perfusion such as G \nforce pooling or hypotension causes without RBC deficits, and decreas ed tissue level oxygen transport such as in \ncyanide poisoning. 1-3 \n \n \nMechanical Ventilation Basics   \n \n CPG ID: 92 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  15 V E N T I L AT I O N   D e f i n i t i o n s  \n1. Minute ventilation (VE) :  Tidal volume multiplied by the respiratory rate (normal is 60cc/kg/min), usually expressed \nin liters (8 -10L.min).  The body regulates carbon dioxide through changes in minute ventilation.  Increases in carbon \ndioxide leads to increased respiratory rate and/or tidal volume and increased minute ventilation (amount of air \nexchanged during one minute of ventilation). 1-3 \n2. Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) :  The greatest pressure within the lungs during inspiration.  Pressures above \n35mmHg have been shown to cause pressure -related lung injury (barotrauma).  Ideally, pressures should remain \nbelow 30 mmHg.  Increased peak pressures are usually due to increase s in resistance or decreased lung compliance \nwithin the respiratory system (e.g., kink in the circuit, mucous plugging, laryngospasm/bronchospasm, tension \npneumothorax, inability for adequate exhalation, edema). 1-3   \n3. Plateau pressure : It is the static pressure achieved at the end of a full inspiration. To measure plateau pressure, we \nneed to perform an inspiratory hold on the ventilator to permit the pressure to equalize through the system. \nPlateau pressure is a measure of alveolar pr essure and lung compliance. Normal plateau pressure is below 30 cm \nH20, and higher pressure can generate barotrauma. Checking a plateau pressure is helpful to delineate between a \nresistance or compliance problem.  If peak pressures are high  and plateau pressures are normal, this is indicative of \na resistance problem (kinked circuit, ventilator asynchrony, laryngospasm, mucous plugging, etc.).  If peak and \nplateau pressure are high, this is more likely from compliance issues such as pneumonia , pulmonary edema, \natelectasis, pneumothorax, abdominal compartment syndrome, etc.).  \n4. End Tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2  ):  Measurement of carbon dioxide on end tidal expiration.  Normal values are 35mmHg -\n45mmHg.  Exhaled gasses are analyzed by either vital signs monitor or portable EtCO 2   devices (e.g., EMMA) a \nquantitative capnograph or capnometer is the clinical standard of care with invasively ventilated patients.  EtCO 2   is \none of the most useful measures to determine overall adequacy of ventilation.  Anyone who is intubating a patient \nand putting them on mechanical ventilation must be able to monitor EtCO 2  .  \n5. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) :  Although continuous pulse oximetry and EtCO 2   can reliably confirm adequate \noxygenation, ventilation, and guide most ventilator changes – ABGs are the gold standard for evaluating acid -base \nstatus, oxygenation, ventilation and adjusting ventilation settings.  If a point of care blood gas analyzer is available, \nthis can enable targeted ventilator setting  changes .  Knowing these values will greatly improve critical care \nguidance via telemedicine resources.  At facility -based  care (Role 2 care and beyond) an arterial line for continuous \nblood pressure monitoring and ABG sampling should be placed . \n6. Normal ABG values:  \n▪ pH (7.35 -7.45)  \n▪ PaO 2 (75-100 mmHg)  \n▪ PaCO 2 (35-45 mmHg)  \n▪ HCO3 (22 -26 meq/L)  \n▪ Base excess/deficit ( -2 to +2)  \n▪ SaO2 (95 -100%)  \nA B G   D E F I N I T I O N S   \nWhile in the PH and rotary wing transport environments, it is rare to obtain an ABG – knowing the normal values is \nimportant to check a patient prior to Role 2 to Role 3 RW transport.  The ABG is extremely useful in trauma resuscitations \nbecause the pH, la ctate and base deficit will give an overall picture of perfusion.  \n1. pH:  Measure of hydrogen ion concentration (i.e. acid -base status).  Acidosis (low pH) leads to \ncoagulopathic states in trauma patients as well as development of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias.  \n2. PaO 2:  Measurement of dissolved oxygen in blood, also a measurement of adequacy of gas exchange at \nthe cellular level.  \nMechanical Ventilation Basics   \n \n CPG ID: 92 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  16 3. PaCO 2:  Measurement of dissolved carbon dioxide in blood, also a measurement of adequacy of gas \nexchange at the cellular level.  \n4. HCO3 :  Measurement of bicarbonate in the blood, serves as a buffer against acid.  \n5. Base excess :  Gives indication of metabolic component of blood gas results, most likely will not change \nfield ventilator management but can provide information for telemedicine consultation regarding \nadequacy of resuscitation.  \n6. SaO 2:  Percentage of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in arterial blood, correlates closely with SpO2 values.  \nV E N T I L AT O R   T E R M S  \n1. Volume -targeted modes :  Volume constant, inspiration terminates when preset VT delivered.  Peak \nairway pressure is variable and increases as needed to deliver prescribed VT.  This is generally \nrepresented by a constant flow waveform.  \n2. Pressure -targeted modes :  Volume variable and dependent on pulmonary compliance.  The vent \nterminates flow of air when the pressure is met.  Peak airway pressure is fixed, determined by set \npressure level.  This is generally represented by a decelerating flow waveform.  \n3. Tidal volume (VT):  Is the volume of gas, exchanged during a breath and commonly expressed in \nmilliliters. VT is generally set between 4 -8 ml/kg ideal body weight (IBW), to prevent lung over distension \nand barotrauma.   \n4. Frequency (f) :  Is the rate, per minute, of breathing (patient or ventilator).  Known as respiratory rate \n(RR).  \n5. Minute Ventilation (Ve) :  Is the average volume of gas entering, or leaving, the lungs per minute, \ncommonly expressed in liters per minute.  The product of VT and RR (respiratory rate).  Normal Ve is 5 – \n10 L/min.  \n6. Inspiratory (I) and Expiratory (E) time and I:E ratio :  Is the period of time over which the VT is delivered.  \nSetting a shorter inspiratory time (I) results in a faster inspiratory flow rate in volume cycled ventilation.  \nAverage adult inspiratory time is 0.7 to 1 second. I:E ratio is usually 1:2.  \n7. Positive end -expiratory pressure (PEEP) :  Is the amount of positive pressure that is maintained at end -\nexpiration.  It is expressed in centimeters of water (cmH2O).  The purpose of PEEP is to increase end -\nexpiratory lung volume and reduce air -space closure at end -expiration.  Normal physiologic PEEP is 5 \ncmH2O.  \n8. Pressure Support (PS) :  Delivers flow at a set pressure, generally to overcome resistance of the airway \nand ventilator circuit.  PS can also be used to support a spontaneously breathing patient, such as with Bi -\nPAP . \n9. Flow :  Is the velocity at which gas is delivered to the patient, expressed in liters per minute.  When the \nflow rate is set higher, the speed of gas delivery is faster and inspiratory time is shorter.  \n10. Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) :  Represents the total pressure that is required to deliver the VT and \ndepends upon various airway resistance, lung compliance, and chest wall factors.  It is expressed in \ncentimeters of water (cmH2O).  \n11. Sensitivity or trigger sensitivity :  Effort, or negative pressure, required by the patient to trigger a \nmachine breath, commonly set so that minimal effort ( -1 to -2 cmH2O) is required to trigger a breath.1,3 \nMechanical Ventilation Basics   \n \n CPG ID: 92 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  17 R E F E R E N C E S  \n1.

The patient can take their own breaths in addition to mandatory \nbreaths, with each spontaneous breath receiving the full preset tidal volume (assist part).  Airway pressures can \nvary during delivery. 1-3 \n▪ Volume Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (V -SIMV) combines mandatory breaths and supported \nbreaths. “synchronized” means it will adjust the delivery of breaths with the patient’s effort. “Intermittent” means \nthat not all breaths are supported.  The ventilator delivers a preset number of mandatory breaths per minute.  Any \nbreath taken over the set RR will not receive the set tidal volume and is solely based on the patient’s lung \ncompliance and effort. Newer models offer PS with patient triggere d breaths.  \nPressure -targeted Modes   \n▪ Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)  supports every patient breath with a preset amount of pressure support.  No \nmandatory breaths are given, so the patient must be spontaneously breathing.  \n▪ Pressure Assist control (P -AC), or Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV)  delivers a set number of mandatory pressure -\ncontrolled breaths, in which the patient receives a fixed pressure during a preset inspiratory time.  Any breaths over \nthe set rate will be pressure controlled with the same amount of pressure.  The delivered ti dal volume will be \nbased on the amount of pressure applied, the lung compliance and airway resistance of the patient.  \nAdaptive Support Ventilation (ASV)  \nASV provides intelligent ventilation mode that continuously adjusts respiratory rate, tidal volume, and inspiratory time \ndepending on the patient’s lung mechanics and effort.  This is similar to “Auto -Flow” or other like settings on different \nbrands of ventilators. Currently only available on the Hamilton -T1.  \nContinuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)  \nCPAP Is a type of positive airway pressure, where the air flow is introduced into the airways to maintain a continuous \npressure to constantly stent the airways open, in people who are breathing spontaneously.1  CPAP provides constant \npressure above that of the atmospheric pressure. Delivered via the upper respiratory tract.  \nPressure Regulated Volume Control (PRVC) Ventilation  \nPRVC ventilation is designed for invasive mechanical ventilation and combines volume and pressure strategies. PRVC delivers \na pressure -controlled and tidal volume (VT) –targeted breath using a decelerating flow waveform pattern that allows \nunrestricted spon taneous breathing with or without pressure support (PS). 2 (may be Impact 731 only). ***  VENTILATOR MODES  \nAPRV  \nAir Pressure \nRelease \nVentilation  The same as DuoPAP but \nwith an inverse I:E ratio.  \nExpiratory/release time too \nshort to return to FRC.  \nThigh sets RR  \nTlow sets TV  As for DuoPAP  \nInverse ratios \nincrease mean \nairway pressure and \nmany increase lung \nrecruitment  \nImproves \noxygenation.

This enables patients to be ventilate d \nin a lung -protective strategy.  A quick reference chart can be found in Appendix C .  IBW can be calculated manually as \nfollows:  \n▪ Male: {(Height in inches -60) x 2.2} +50 (e.g. 72in -60= 12; 12 x 2.2 = 26.4; 26.4 + 50 = IBW of 76.4 kg)  \n▪ Female: {(Height in inches -60) x 2.2} +45 (e.g. 65in -60= 5; 5 x 2.2 = 11; 11 + 45 = IBW of 56 kg)  \nMinute Ventilation (VE)  \nThe average volume of gas entering, or leaving, the lungs per minute, commonly expressed in liters per minute.  Also called \nminute volume.  Minute ventilation is the product of VT and RR (respiratory rate).  Normal VE is 5 – 10 L/min. 4-8 \nI:E Ratio  \nSee I:E definition.  I:E might need to be adjusted for physiology that requires extended exhalation time. 4-8    For example: \nAsthma patient may require an I:E of 1:3, 1:4, or 1:5 to allow for more exhalation time.  \nFlow Rate  \nIs the velocity at which gas is delivered to the patient, expressed in liters per minute.  When the flow rate is set higher, the \nspeed of gas delivery is faster and inspiratory time is shorter. 4-8 \nPeak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP)  \nRepresents the total pressure that is required to deliver the VT and depends upon various airway resistance, lung \ncompliance, and chest wall factors.  It is expressed in centimeters of water (cm H2O).  \nSensitivity or trigger sensitivity  \nTrigger sensitivity Is the effort, or negative pressure, required by the patient to trigger a machine breath, commonly set so  \nthat minimal effort ( -1 to -2 cm H2O) triggers a breath.1,3  This is usually seen with assist modes of ventilator operation.  \nPressure alarms  \nPressure alarms ensure that providers are alerted to pressures that fall outside of appropriate ranges and have potential to \nharm the patient via barotrauma (over -pressure) or under -ventilation (circuit disconnect or under -pressure).  Pressures will \nbe determined by placing the patient on the vent for ~1 -2 minutes  and determining intrinsic peak inspiratory pressure. \n(Labeled as PEAK on 754 Ventilator (top right); Labeled as peak on Hamilton T1 ventilator (top left); Labeled as PIP on ZOLL \nEMV+ (731) (right center).  Standard alarm settings should be: Need to measur e a peak pressure 5 min after setting initial \nsettings.  \n▪ High pressure alarm: 10 cmH2O above peak airway pressure.  \n▪ Low pressure alarm: 5 cmH2O below peak airway pressure.  \n \n \nMechanical Ventilation Basics   \n \n CPG ID: 92 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  21 R e f e r e n c e s  \n1.

This applies to off -label uses with patients who \nare armed f orces members.   \nBACKGROUND  \nUnapproved (i.e. “off -label”) uses of FDA -approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are usually \nnot subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved \ndrugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part \nof clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved \nuses may also be subject to speci al regulations.   \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS  \nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it does not \nimply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard \nof care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care \npractitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for t he \nclinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship.  \nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES  \nBalanced Discussion  \nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by the FDA. \nFurther, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that \nsugge st caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA -issued warnings.  \nQuality Assurance Monitoring  \nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring of \noutcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.  \nInformation to Patients  \nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an unusual off -\nlabel use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be given to including in an  \nappendix  an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product. \nInformation to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a \nDoD health care practitio ner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with \nsuch use.  \n \n \n",

It is a guideline only and not a substitute\nfor clinical judgment.  It is based upon the best information av ailable at the time of publication.  It is\ndesigned to provide information and assist decision making.  It should not be interpreted as prescribing an\nexclusive course of management.  It was developed by experts in this field.  Variations in practice will\ninevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients,\navailable resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice.

2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 Intended Scope and Audience\nThis guideline is intended for  the provider operating in an austere , limited resource setting .  Providers\nhave varying levels  of knowledge, training,  and experience in basic critical care concepts.  It is not\nintended to be all inclusive, but to spur further thinking and identify areas where r esource limitations or\nknown disease s specif y changes to usual practices .  The management strategy described is designed for\na 24-hour hold of a single critically ill patient and is tailored to the equipment and medications typically\navailable in austere  operational  settings ( Role 1 and Expeditionary Role 2 ).  Refer to the most updated\nDoD COVID-19 Practice Management Guide  for recommended clinical man agement, and CENTCOM\nCOVID -19 Playbook for operational considerations.\nGuiding Principles\n1) Our primary mission remains the same.   We must maintain the ability to provide damage control\nresuscitation and surgery in support of combat operations .\n2) Prevention o f disease  transmission to medical personnel is a mission critical consideration for\naustere teams as there is generally very limited skill redundancy.\n3) Primary capability limitations  may  include manpower, oxygen supply, ventilators, medications, and\nperson al protective equipment (PPE).\n4) Care of the critically ill COVID -19 patient is primarily supportive medical care plus appropriate\ndisease transmission precautions.\n5) Use of telemedicine to push critical care expertise as far forward as possible should be part  of the\noperational plan.\nKey Assumptions\n1) Most providers operating in austere locations have equipment geared towards combat casualty\ncare, not  necessarily  care for patients in severe respiratory failure.\n2) Oxygen supply is generally limited to a few portabl e oxygen tanks  and oxygen concentrators not\ndesigned to provide high volume oxygen support .\n3) Laboratory and radiologic evaluation capabilities are generally limited  to non -existent.\n4) Local and international supply lines have been significantly affected by COVID -19, with reduced\nresupply or  delivery of disease specific supplies  (e.g. , testing kits and viral filters ).\n5) Time to medical evacuation may  be significantly prolonged given the global nature of this crisis ,\nlockdown over sovereign airspaces,  and the need  to limit impact to military air assets.\n6) Most austere locations consist of relatively small camps  (usually less than 100- 300 personnel ) with\nprimarily younger, healthier population s.  However, some personnel may fall into high risk\ncategories.  As such, based upon current epidemiology,  planning should account for  1-3 critically ill\npatients at each austere location.\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 ( ID:85) 23 Apr 2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 Key Definitions\n1) Quarantine :  Separation and restriction of movement (ROM) for personnel  potentially exposed to a\ncontagious disease but withou t symptoms of illness.  These personnel  may have been exposed to a\ndisease and do not know it, or they may have the disease but do not show symptoms.  This is a\ncommand function that is medically supported.\n2) Isolation :  Separation of sick personnel  with a confirmed contagious disease or high index of\nsuspicion (i.e. person under investigation) from people who are not sick.  This is a medical function requiring command support .\n3) Person  Under Investigation (PUI):   A patient with signs and symptoms consistent wi th COVID -19\ninfection and possible exposure to the virus.  In areas where COVID -19 is already widespread,\nsymptoms alone may make the diagnosis of “PUI.”  All PUIs must be isolated.\n4) Contact Spread:  Spread of disease via direct contact with an infected pat ient or contaminated\nsurface.  Contact precautions aim to mitigate this method of transmission.\n5) Droplet Spread:  Spread of disease via relatively large liquid particles that settle from the air\n,\ntypically within a few feet .  Droplet precautions aim to miti gate this method of transmission.\n6) Airborne Spread:  Spread of disease via small liquid particles (aerosols) that remain aloft for\nprolonged periods of time and may travel longer distances.  Airborne precautions aim to mitigate\nthis method of transmission.\nKey References\n1) Alhazzani W, Hylander M, Arabi Y, et al.

Tracheal Intubation\nb. Extubation (accidental or planned)\nc. Bag-Valve Mask Ventilation\nd. Any disconnection of the ventila tor circuit\ne. Tracheal suctioning without in -line suction device\nf. Tracheostomy (and Cricothyroidotomy)\ng. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation\nLevels of PPE\nLevels are based upon risk o f disease and risk of procedure .\nNOTE :  the patient should wear a basic facemask ( cloth or otherwise) whenever feasible to provide an\nadditional barrier.\nMinimum :  Face covering, eye protection glasses, gloves, and makeshift gown.\nNOTE: F or patients with low probability of disease and where direct contact with the patient is low,\ngown s may not be required (mirroring conventional droplet precautions).\nBetter :  Surgical mask or N95 mask, face shield (either standalone or with mask) and eye protection,\ngloves, gown (surgical or contact), head covering.\nBest :  N95 mask (with or without sur gical mask covering) with face shield and disposable head covering\nor hooded face shield (e.g. , Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives ( CBRNE)\npro-mask) along with gown and gloves.\nConservation of PPE\n1) COVID -19 can survive on  various surfaces for up to 72 hours or longer.\n2) Use cloth face covering when risk is low to conserve supply of surgical face masks and N95 masks\nneeded for high risk procedures (e.g.,  endotracheal intubation).\n3) Doff PPE in a manner that allows for it to be easily donned again without contacting contaminated\nsurfaces (if possible).\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 4) For re -use of surgical face masks or N95 masks: while wearing gloves, store the mask in a paper bag\nin a dry, shaded/indoor area for 72 hours  prior to using again.  DO NOT use blea ch or UV radiation\n(i.e. sunlight) to ‘sterilize’ the N95 –  this will degrade mask effectiveness.\n5) Eye protection glasses and face shields should be cleaned with a diluted bleach solution between\nuses.\nMask Recommendations\nU.S. National Institute for Occup ational Safety and Health recommends the following for extended use\nand re-use of N95 respirators:\n1) N95 masks maintain their effectiveness for at least 8  hours  of continuous or intermittent use.\n2) N95 masks should be discarded following aerosol generating pro cedures (e.g.,  endotracheal\nintubation) or when visibly contaminated with bodily fluids.\n3) Consider using a large face shield that sits in front of the mask, wear a surgical mask over -top of the\nN95, or masking the patient to minimize contamination.\n4) Perform hand hygiene with soap and water or an alcohol -based hand sanitizer before and after\ntouching or adjusting the mask.\nQuarantine (Asymptomatic Personnel with Identified Exposure)\n1) While separate berthing for quarantined individuals is optimal, living space is generally limited in austere settings.  As such, berthing with individual rooms should provide adequate protection to allow quarantined individuals to remain in their room.\n2) Individuals placed on quarantine per CDC screening guidelines are instructed to s tay in their room\nand conduct self -observation for the development of any symptoms.\n3) Teammates should check on the status of the quarantined individual several times daily and bring them food, water, and comfort items as needed.\n4) Social distancing is strictl y enforced when the individual needs to use the bathroom for toilet and\nhygiene.  They should not use the gym, MWR, or any other common areas while under quarantine.\n5) Depending on risk to force and mission requirements, mission critical personnel (including  medical\npersonnel) could be allowed to work ( face covering, N -95 if possible, otherwise a cloth mask may be\nused) .  Early engagement of nonmedical leadership in such decision making is essential.\nIsolation (Symptomatic Personnel)\n1) PUI may not  leave isolati on berthing unless instructed to do so by medical personnel.\n2) When outside of the isolation berthing, PUI will be required to wear a cloth face covering and clean\nhands with soap and water or alcohol based hand sanitizer.\n3) No visitors allowed within the isolation berthing.\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 ( ID:85) 23 Apr 2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9 Initial Medical Evaluation\n1) Pre-designate a provider as the COVID provider.  This provider should perform all evaluations and\nprocedures to limit exposure to other medical personnel, if possible.  Remember, maintaining\ncombat casualty care capability is still the priority .  Balance the provider skillset and experience with\npotential impact on medical support for combat operations.  The designated provider may not be\nthe most experienced provider, but can consult with teammates as needed for management,\nprocedures, and nursing care.\n2) All patients presenting to sick call with any complaint should be screened for typical COVID -19\nsymptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, gastrointestinal complaints) and risk of exposure.\n3) If PUI presents to a provider other than the designated COVID attending provider, the patient should\nbe provided a cloth face covering (or surgical mask) and escorted to pre -designated COVID\ntreatment area.\n4) If possible, all evaluations and treatment of PUI should be done outside the combat  casualty care\nfacility to mitigate potential for contamination of the facility.\n5) Medical personnel performing the evaluation should wear the best available PPE (see Appendix B )\nbalancing the supply of PPE with the threat of pat ient interaction.\n6) Examination should include full vital signs including pulse oximetry, work of breathing assessment,\npulmonary auscultation, skin temperature, and capillary refill.\nAncillary  Tests\nMinimum : Rapid Malaria Testing (if febrile in malaria ende mic region)\nBetter  (Above +):\n 12-Lead ECG\n Rapid Flu Testing\n Rapid Dengue Testing\n I-STAT  arterial blood gas or venous blood gas\n Ultrasound (cardiac and pulmonary)\nBest  (Above +):\n PA and LAT Chest Films\n Respiratory Pathogen Film Array (i.e. Biofire)\n COVID -19 PCR Testing\n Other laboratory testing listed DoD COVID19 Practice Management Guide\nIdentifying Patients at Risk for Deterioration:\n1) Among patients with mild to moderate symptoms and normal resting pulse oximetry, the risk of\ndeterioration is increased in those presenting with dyspnea, desaturation on exercise testing, and\nepidemiologic risk factors for severe disease (age over 50, cardiovascular dise ase, pulmonary\ndisease, immunosuppressive medications).  These patients should be monitored closely and\nconsidered for early evacuation.\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  10 2) Exercise (Walk) Test : Have the patient jog or walk in place for 3 minutes.  Inability to complete the\ntest or desaturat ion below SpO 2 <94% confers a higher risk for clinical deterioration.  This is a triage\ntest used by several New York hospitals during the pandemic to help gauge the need for closer\nmonitoring.\nConsideration of Alternative Diagnoses\n1) If a patient with sympt oms possibly consistent with COVID -19 has known risk for or exposure to\nCOVID -19, the patient should be managed as a PUI regardless of the differential diagnosis.  This does\nnot mean that alternative and/or comorbid diagnoses are impossible as COVID -19 pat ients can be\nco-infected with other pathogens.\n2) Life threatening alternative diagnoses (e.g. , pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, acute myocardial\ninfarction, etc.) should always be considered and managed according to standard practices for diagnosis and trea tment.\nTesting in Austere Locations\n1) Most austere locations will be unable to test for COVID -19 using an approved polymerase chain\nreaction  (PCR) assay.  However, if testing does become available, the following should be\nconsidered:\n The false negative rate for COVID -19 PCR assay is likely to be significant enough to merit a\nminimum period of isolation (or quarantine) regardless of test result.\n Testing priority should be guided by the CDC priority for testing balanced against operational priorities.  For exam ple, a patient with mild symptoms and no risk factors for decompensation\nmay not warrant immediate testing.  However, if combatant command determines that the individual is mission critical, the testing may be considered a higher priority.\n2) Given significan t resource constraints in an austere environment (specifically the limited duration of\noxygen supply, medication supply, and limited quantity of PPE) coordination for evacuation to the\nappropriate level of care should be initiated as soon as possible, even  if the patient does not\nnecessarily need urgent evacuation as it may take more than 24 hours to execute an evacuation mission.  This underscores the importance for early evacuation coordination while simultaneously planning for prolonged care.\n3) Appendix A\ndescribes a tiered Medical Condition (MedCon) flowchart developed for standardization\nof terminology across an area of responsibility ( AOR ) and between medical providers, medical\nplanners, and operational leadership.\nIsolation Billeting Location Considerations\n1) Most austere locations have group billet ing with shared ventilation, making the practice of ‘self -\nisolation’ impractical.  While individual billeting with separated bathrooms is optimal, patient\nisolation cohorts may be th e best option available with limited space.\n2) Billeting should be able to expand to hold multiple patients of varying severity and allow adequate\ncomfort for all patient categories (mild, moderate, and severe illness).\n3) Billeting ventilation (i.e. environment al control units) should face away from any gathering areas\nand common walkways.\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  11 4) Billeting entrances should be well marked (e.g. , “Isolation Area -  No Unauthorized Access!”)\nand include posted guides on proper PPE procedures.\n5) Consider location relative to  bathrooms and areas traversed to get to the bathrooms.  If available,\ndesignate bathrooms for isolated patients only.  If there is engineering support, a pit toilet can be\nconstructed.  Disposable water bottles can be used as urinals.\n6) Consider designating a critical care area within or near the isolation area separate f rom the main\nmedical facility/ aid station.  Additionally, consider the route that must be traversed in order to\ntransport the patient to an evacuation platform.  The focus should be, as much  as possible, on\npreserving the ability to provi de combat casualty care, if needed.\n7) If confirmatory testing is available, considering cohorting isolated patients by positive test vs.\nuntested or negative test to avoid needlessly infecting PUIs who do not i n-fact have COVID -19.\nPreparation of Isolation Billeting\n1) Do not move PUI into isolation billeting before preparation is complete .\n2) All non -isolated personnel occupying the space must vacate the building .\n3) Allow PUI (while wearing a surgical mask) to gather p ersonal belongings from lodging and move into\nisolation berthing.\na. Personal hygiene items\nb. Bed sheets and clothing\nc. Electronic devices + chargers\n4) If PUI is unable to retrieve items, personnel with mask + gloves (at minimum) should retrieve any\nessential items .\n5) Basic medical items remain in isolation billet ing at all times:\na. Oral t hermometer with box of sheaths\nb. Pulse oximeter(s)\nc. Alcohol based hand sanitizer\nd. Stethoscope(s)\ne. Manual blood pressure cuff(s)\nf. Box of surgical masks\ng. 14 day supply of Acetaminophen , ibuprof en and cold/flu medicine as available.\n6) PPE Box (for providers, prepositioned outside isolation berthing):\na. Min 3 g owns (either surgical or yellow contact precaution gowns)\nb. Min 3 N95 masks\nc. Min 6 s urgical masks\nd. Min 3 face shields and/or cleaned eyepro\ne. Min 3 s urgical caps or bouffant caps\nf. Box of gloves\ng. Tub of disinfectant wipes\nh. Spray bottle of dilute bleach\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  12 i. Paper towels (for cleaning)\nj. Trash bags\n7) Life Support Items\na. Hydration:  Water bottles, juice containers, Gatorade, etc.\nb. Food: MREs, meal supplement drinks, sn acks, etc.  Provide hot -meals as able.\nc. Hygiene :  Box of wet wipes.  Encourage use of portable urinals (e.g. , empty water bottles).  If the\nbathroom must be shared with non -isolated personnel or if a designated bathroom traverses\ncommon areas, the PUI shoul d be escorted by personnel wearing PPE while themselves wearing\na mask.  The escort will instruct anyone inside the bathroom to vacate prior to use.  All surfaces\nused by the PUI must be cleaned with dilute bleach solution.\nd. Trash:  Small trash receptacle w ith bag inside isolation berthing.  Large receptacle double\nbagged will be placed immediately outside the isolation berthing.  Biohazard s ign will be placed\non top.  Only medical personnel or designated non -essential/non -high risk personnel will\ndispose of  this trash to minimize risk to others.  PUI will be instructed to tie off small bags and\nplace in a large container daily.  Consider the local population access to trash and dispose\nfollowing approved policy for biohazardous waste.\nContinued Monitoring Co nsiderations for Personnel in  Outpatient  Isolation\n1) Maintain communication with personnel in isolation.  The attending  COVID provider will determine\nthe need for more frequent assessments.\n2) Once a patient meets MedCon2 criteria or higher, continuous monitori ng is recommended as their\nrisk of rapid decompensation rises significantly . (MedCon2: Progressive symptoms that are\nconcerning based upon provider clinical judgment. See Appendix A .)\n3) The Prolonged Field Care flowsheet  provides  a framework for recording frequent assessments and\ninterventions . (See JTS Documentation in Prolonged Field Care CPG .)\n4) Consider using video chat (e.g.,  WhatsApp) to obtain vital signs and perform visual assessment of\npatient to minimize exposure in MedCon1 .  (MedCo n1: Mild flu -like symptoms, SpO2 >94% on room\nair, hemodynamically normal.  See Appendix A .)  Patients can t ake their own pulse oximetry reading\nand temperature at pre-determined intervals or cohort patients in isolation billet ing can do it for\neach other.\n5) If concerning symptoms develop, the COVID attending provider performs an in -person exam using\nthe best avai lable PPE.\nCommand and Control Considerations\n1) Notification of both medical and operational leadership is imperative and should occur soon after identification of a PUI.\n2) Official notification in an approved format should be drafted and submitted to the command\nsurgeon (or appropriate designee).\n3) If MedCon2 or higher risk category, begin coordination for evacuation to a higher echelon of care as\nsoon as possible.\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  13 4) Identify potential close contacts of PUI, screen for symptoms, and manage according to CDC\nguideli nes for high risk exposure.\nPerformance Improvement Measures\nPopulation of Interest\nAll hospitalized patients who are COVID -19 positive (includes confirmed and presumptive cases when\ntesting is not available).\nIntent (Expected Outcomes)\n1) Initial presenting symptoms are documented in the population of interest.\n2) Co-morbidities are documented in the population of interest.\n3) COVID test sample collection and result times are documented in the population of interest.\n4) When intubation is required, staff  document levels of use (level 1 -surgical mask, level 2 -N95, level 3 -\nPowered air -purifying respirator ( PAPR) ).\n5) Recommended treatments for severe and critical COVID -19 patients are received early after hospital\nadmission.\nPerformance/Adherence Metrics\n1) Number and percent age of patients with initial presenting symptoms  are documented in the h istory\nand physical (H&P ) record .\n2) Number and percentage of patients with a complete past medical history ( PMH ) are documented in\nthe H&P.\n3) Number and percentage of patients with smoking history are documented in the H&P.\n4) Document ed number and percentage of patients with COVID test sample collection and result\ntimes.\n5) Number and percentage of patients requiring intubation procedures  who have documentation of\nlevel of PPE used by staff (lev el 1-surgical mask, level 2 -N95, level 3 -PAPR).\n6) Number and percentage of severe and critical patients receiving remdesivir in < 24 hrs and < 48 hrs.\n7) Number and percentage of severe and critical patients receiving dexamethasone in < 24 hrs and < 48 hrs.\n8) Number and percentage of severe and critical patients receiving COVID convalescent plasma  (CCP)\nin < 24 hrs and < 48 hrs.\nData Source\n Patient Record\n DoDTR\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  14 System  Reporting &  Frequency\n The previous  sections constitute the minimum criteria for PI monitoring of this CPG.  System\nreporting will be performed annually; additional PI monitoring and system reporting may be\nperformed as needed.\n The JTS Chief, JTS Program Manager, and the JTS PI Branch will perform the system review and\ndata analysis.\nResponsibilities\nIt is the trauma team leader’s responsibility to ensure familiarity, appropriate compliance , and PI\nmonitoring at the local level with this CPG.\nProviding Med ical Care to a COVID -19 PUI\nOxygen Supply Considerations\n(See Appendix  F)\n1) Take inventory of the equipment and supplies available at your treatment facility.  Important items\ninclude small oxygen concentrators (SAROSTM), oxygen cylinders (D -cylinders and H- cylinders), and\noxygen generating systems (POGS and EDOCS).\n2) Identif y the closest resource capable of filling oxygen cylinders.  This may be a military biomedical\nmaintenance team or host nation industrial gas supply company.\n3) If you locate empty oxygen cylinders, begin the process  of filling them right away.  You will likely\nconsume them quickly if you get a very seriously ill COVID -19 patient.\n4) Develop a resupply plan for your oxygen cylinders.  A very seriously ill COVID -19 patient will rapidly\ndeplete oxygen supplies.\n If your facility has the capability to fill oxygen cylinders, then develop a plan to refill tanks.  Identify someone not directly involved in patient care since tank refill and patient care may need to occur simultaneously.\n If your facility does not have the capability to refill oxygen cylinders, then develop a re-supply\nplan.  One option is to coordinate medical cylinder exchange in conjunction with MEDEVAC missions.\n5) The SAROS\nTM oxygen concentrator can provide up to 3 Lpm of 100% O 2.  However, when unplugged,\nbattery will only last 30 minutes on continuous fl ow.\n6) SAROSTM can be daisy -chained together to provide higher flow, approximating 5 -6 Lpm.  A suction\nY-connector can be used to connect several together.\n7) Ventilators waste less oxygen when using a high pressure hose.  A full D -cylinder providing 15 Lpm\nof O 2 via disposable oxygen tubing will last 20 -30 minutes.  The same D -cylinder providing 100% FiO 2\nthrough a ventilator connected via green high pressure hosing will last 30 -45 minutes (depending on\nminute ventilation).\n8) Reducing minute ventilation (e.g. , sedation with or without  paralysis) and oxygen consumption\n(reduce FiO 2 to absolute minimum to attain SpO 2 88-92%) will extend oxygen supplies.\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  15 9) If transporting patient(s) to an evacuation pick-up site, anticipate delay and bring double the\nestimated oxygen su pply.\nVentilator Considerations\n(See Appendix  G, Appendix H and Appendix I)\n1) Minimum requirement for an effective ventilator in severe hypoxic respiratory failure:\na. Must  be able to provide Positive End- Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) .\nb. Must allow for titration of tidal volume and respiratory rate (control minute ventilation) .\nc. Must be able to provide supplemental oxygen greater than room air (>21% FiO 2).\n2) Commercial full function  ventilators (e.g. , Drager, Puritan -Bennett) may be  available at some\naustere locations and are  the ideal ventilator s to use if available.  These ventilators can perform\nadvanced ventilation strategies and are indicated for treatment of COVID patients.\nNote :  They are not transport ventilators, as the instruments are sensitive and should remain in an\narea where they can be protected.   Transfer the patient to a transport vent for evacuation.\n3) The Zoll (Impact)  EMV+ 731 transport ventilator is available in many military equipment sets and\ncertified to function in all aviation environments.  IMPACT 754 ventilators are sufficient, but do not provide Pressure Control -  Inverse Ratio Ventilation capability (discussed below).\n4) Hamilton T1 transport ventilators pro vide specialized support options, including advanced pressure\ncontrol options and integrated high flow oxygen therapy.  Certified for ground transport and rotary -\nwing transport, but not approved for fixed wing aircraft (pressurized cabin) transport .\n5) SAVe I I rescue ventilators are an option with limited capability:  PEEP only up to 10 cm H\n2O and\nminute ventilation only up to 8 Lpm.  Oxygen reservoir tubing for the air intake is required to provide supplemental oxygen.  If this is the only device available at  your location, arrange transfer to\na location  with more advanced ventilator as soon as possible.\n6) SAVe I rescue ventilator has no adjustability and cannot provide PEEP.  DO NOT manage critically ill COVID -19 patients with this device.  Manual ventilation w ith a Bag -Valve -Mask (BVM), PEEP valve,\nand supplemental oxygen will be more effective.\nPersonnel Considerations\n1) Minimize the number of personnel required to care for the PUI.  Establish a priority list of who will\nbe available to assist.  Ensure that the rest of the team can maintain the combat casualty care\ncapability.\n2) In cases where evacuation may be delayed, establish work -rest cycles, allowing for adequate time to\nhydrate, eat, and sleep.  This has been shown to reduce PPE waste, minimize provider exha ustion,\nand prevent accidental exposures.\n3) Ambulatory PUIs (“walking wounded”) can potentially assist in monitoring and providing care to more seriously ill patients.\n4) Consider having someone (not directly involved in patient care) act as a runner.\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  16 Equipment /Supplies\nThe equipment and supplies needed for the management of a critical ill COVID -19 patient are\nsummarized in Appendix L and Appendix M.\nClinical Care Considerations\nInitial reports suggest th at among COVID -19 patients who develop critical illness, the rapid decline\ntypically starts about 5 -7 days following the first symptoms.  Closely monitoring these patients during\nthis time period is critical for early intervention.\nAirway Management\n1) Minimi ze viral aerosol formation and direct exposure of medical personnel.\n2) Use the best available PPE for high risk procedures like endotracheal intubation.  (See Appendix B .)\n3) Gauge the need for inserting an advanced airway on the pat ient work of breathing.  COVID -19\npatients decompensate rapidly – a low threshold for intubation allows more time for preparation\nand may prevent complications.\n4) If the COVID attending provider does not feel comfortable with placing an advanced airway,\ncons ider teleconsultation and/or waiting for arrival of more experienced personnel\n(e.g. , evacuation team).  Never try to place an advanced airway unless you know how to do it .\n5) One assistant is sufficient  during intubation  in most cases; however, an additional assistant can be\nstanding by in the “warm” zone at least 2 meters away wearing appropriate PPE.\n6) Passively pre -oxygenate with 100% O 2 for at least 5 minutes.  Consider placing a surgical mask on\nthe patient ( over top of nasal cannula or non -rebreather  mask).\n7) Utilize strict rapid sequence intubation  technique – avoid BVM  ventilation if possible.  If available,\nplace viral filter in-line during use of BVM.\n8) Utilize video laryngoscopy  (i.e. GlideS cope) if available for intubation to limit direct exposure.  If\nunable to intubate or obtain adequate vocal cord visualization on the first pass, consider the placement of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) with viral filter.  Ventilate with the BVM and PEEP\nvalve until oxygenation is adequate.  Then, re-attempt the procedu re.\n9) Chest X -Ray may not be available or feasible to confirm tube placement.  Utilize  end-tidal carbon\ndioxide (EtCO\n2) monitoring and auscultation to confirm placement.\n10) General guide for tube size and  depth is as follows:  for males use 8.0 endotracheal tube  (ETT)\ninserted to 25cm at the incisors; for females use 7.0 ETT inserted to 23cm at the incisors.\nIn general, place as large an ETT as possible since secretions may be an issue.\n11) If available, place heated humidification device (e.g. , Hamilton H900) or heat and moisture\nexchanger (HME) in the INHALATION circuit of the ventilator tubing.  If available, place a HEPA filter\n(microbiological filter) or HME -F (HME plus microbiological filter) in the EXAHALTION circuit of\nventilator tubing.\nCricothyroidotomy\nCricothyroidotomy  for definitive airway management:\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  17 1) Many medics and other providers operating independently in far -forward environments are trained\nto use cricothyroidotomy as their primary definitive airway.  While the use of a surgical airway first\nline is appropriate in patients presenting in -extremis or with the loss of an airway (e.g.,  severely\ninjured trauma patients with facial or neck trauma), patients with COVID -19 generally present with\ngradually progressive symptoms and intact native airways.\n2) Early intra -theater transfer to a facility with advanced capabilities is preferable to early\ncricothyroidotomy whenever possible.\n3) Laryngeal mask airway or other supraglottic  airway placement may be a sufficient bridge to\ndefinitive airway placement.  Placement  of a mask over the LMA (hole cut in the middle of the mask\nfor the LMA) will minimize aerosol spread from any  air leak.  PEEP above 10 cm H 2O via LMA may\nnot be effective and may exacerbate any leak around the LMA.  Sedation and analgesic\nrequirements for  an LMA may be slightly more than with a cricothyroidotomy.\n4) Cricothyroidotomy without the ability to provide mechanical ventilation consumes significant\nresources (manpower required to bag- ventilate the patient with PEEP, inefficient delivery of oxygen\nvia bag-ventilation, and significant aerosol risk to those providing care).\nMedication Options\nSystemic C orticosteroids\nProfessional societies recommend using  systemic corticosteroids  in the treatment of severe and critical\nCOVID -19 (see the DoD COVID-19 PMG  for more details) .  If unfamiliar with corticosteroid treatment\nregimens, discuss with advanced provider via telehealth prior to initiating therapy.\nAntimicrobial Therapy\n(to treat possible bacterial pneumonia co -infection)\n1) Consider early use of azithromycin (500mg  PO or IV  daily for a minimum of 5 days) to treat mild to\nmoderate community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients with lower respiratory t ract symptoms\nand fever.\n2) If azithromycin is not available, doxycycline (100mg PO or IV q12h) can be substituted for empiric\ntreatment of bacterial pneumonia.\n3) For patients with severe symptoms, recommend adding ceftriaxone (IV 2gm q24h is the best option)\nor ampicillin- sulbactam (3gm IV q6hr is a good alternative) or ertapenem (1g IV or IM q24h if it is the\nonly available option).\n4) Levofloxacin (750mg  PO or IV  q24h) is another reasonable option for empiric treatment of severe\ncommunity -acquired pneumonia.\nFever M anagement\nFever management  with acetaminophen every 6 hours (1000mg IV or 975mg PO  or PR) as needed for\ntemperature over 38°C.\nSedation and Analgesia\n1) Sedation goal is  Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS ) -1 to -2 (comfortable, transiently\nresponsive to verbal stimulation) and synchronous with the ventilator.  Increase sedation and/or\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  18 add narcotics to improve patient-ventilator synchrony.  Use of paralytics may be required for very\nsevere cases (as discussed below).\n2) Ketamine may cause increased secretions which may require more frequent suctioning.\nIf medication options are limited, consider more frequent dosing of midazolam to decrease the dose of ketamine required and potentially decrease the secretion burden.\n3) A reference guide for starting a nd titrating a ketamine drip along with useful adjuncts is provided in\nJTS Ana lgesia and Sedation Management during Prolonged Field Care  CPG\n.\n4) Combined use of multiple sedatives (i.e. propofo l, dexmedetomidine and/or midazolam) may act\nsynergistically to decrease the total sedative dose and help to mitigate the hypotensive effects of propofol , however multiple continuous drips is not recommended outside of an ICU setting.  A\nketamine drip may be combined with bolus doses of additional medications.\n5) Caution should be used with combining propofol and dexmedetomidine , especially in younger\npatients with higher vagal tone due to increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension.\n6) Intermittent or doses  of fentanyl or hydromorphone may be useful for analgesia and optimizing\nventilator synchrony.\n7) Low dose vasopressors may be necessary to support hemodynamics in the face of deeper sedation and higher PEEP . (See Appendix D\n.)\nBronch odilation\n1) Use of metered-dose-inhalers (MDIs) over nebulized bronchodilators  to treat wheezing  will help to\nminimize risk for infectious aerosol.\n2) If the ventilator tubing does not have a capped inlet for medication administration (aka MDI\nadapter) -- 1) clamp the ETT, 2) disconnect the ventilator, and 3) administer the MDI (6 puffs)\ndirectly into the INHALATION circuit.  Then, reconnect the ventilator and unclamp ETT to insufflate the medication.\n3) Magnesium Sulfate 2gm IV over 20 minutes (similar to treatment of an asthma exacerbation) may be a safer alternative for treatment of bronchospasm given the risks of disconnecting the circuit.\nRespiratory Care\nLung- protective ventilation\n1) Initiate lung- protective ventilation strategy.\na. Tidal volume 6mL/kg ideal body w eight (IBW)\n IBW – Men = 50 kg + (2.3 kg x (height in inches - 60))\n IBW – Women = 45.5 kg + (2.3 kg x (height in inches - 60))\nb. Maintain peak pressure less than 35  mm Hg\nc. Maintain SpO 2 88-95% or PaO 2 55-80 mm Hg\nd. Permit Hypercarbia (but  keep arterial pH > 7.30 )\ne. Use ARDSnet protocol . (See Appendix E)\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  19 2) If ETT must be disconnected from the ventilator for ANY reason, clamp the ETT to prevent\ndecruitment and minimize viral aerosol formation.\n3) If in-line suction devices are not available, de -recruitment will likely occur with suctioning.  Salvage\nrecruitment maneuvers may be necessary.\n4) On the  EMV+  731  (mode AC -V) a recruitment maneuver can be done as follows:\na. Change upper limit of Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) alarm to 50  cm H20.\nb. Decrease  tidal v olume as low as possible (50mL) .\nc. Increase PEEP to 30 -40 cm H20.\nd. Hold for 40 seconds (if signs of hemodynamic instability develop, stop the recruitment\nmaneu ver, and resume prior settings) .\ne. Increase PEEP to 2  cm H20 ABOVE prior PEEP setting .\nf. Increas e tidal volume back to prior setting.\ng. Return upper limit of PIP alarm to prior set ting.\nh. Monitor for any persistence of hemodynamic instability or persistently high PIP (Although rare,\nthe high PIP encountered dur ing RMs can cause pneumothorax) .\n5) Dry Lung.   The mantra “a dry  lung is a happy lung” still applies in severe COVID -19 care; over\nresuscitation is likely to be harmful.  Fluid resuscitation should be guided by assessment of volume\nresponsiveness.  If available and evacuation is significantly delayed, loop diuretics can be used to\nattain a net even volume status, providing the patient is hemodynamically stable\n(i.e. not requiring vasopressor support).\nManagement of Oxygenation\n1) Escalate PEEP to 12  cm H20 as aggressively as possible as hemodynamics allow  to optimize\noxygenation, minimize FiO 2 needs, and extend oxygen supply.\n2) Use the ARDSNet Protocol LOW PEEP table as a guide for further titration of PEEP.  Refer to JTS Acute Respiratory Failure CPG\n.\n3) Be prepared to start vasopressors and judicious use of IVF to support pre -load in the face of high\nPEEP (aka PEEP tamponade).\n4) Consider a combination of paralysis and prone positioning early to lengthen duration of available\noxygen supply.\n5) Consider Inverse Ratio Ventilation (IRV) once patient reaches PEEP 18  cm H20 on the LOW PEEP\ntable.\nManagement of Ventilation\n1) If blood gas analysis is not available, a general EtCO 2 goal of 35 mm Hg +/ - 5, is adequate.  However,\nif blood gas analysis is available  (i.e. i-STAT ), recommend obtaining a baseline PCO 2 and correlate\nwith EtCO 2, especially since the gradient between the two is much wider in patients with significant\nlung disease (i.e. an EtCO 2 of 40 may actually represent a PCO 2 of 60 with a pH around 7. 24).\n2) The manual breath button on the bottom left of EMV+ 731 allows for manual measurement of\nplateau pressure (Pplat).  The Pplat goal is less than 30  cm H2O with a secondary goal of maintaining\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  20 driving pressure (Pplat minus PEEP) below 15 cm  H2O.  In the  absence of Pplat, a PIP target of less\nthan 35  cm H20 is also reasonable.\n3) If Pplat is greater than 30  cm H20, decrease set tidal volume by 1 mL/kg steps (about 50 -80 mL).\nTitrate set respiratory rate (RR) up increments of 2 bpm to maintain pH and EtCO 2 at goal.  Avoid RR\nabove 35 bpm given significant risk for breath stacking and auto PEEP (which will eventually make\nthe patient hemodynamically unstable).\n4) If i-STAT with blood gas cartridges are available, consider serial blood gas evaluation (adjusting\nfrequency depending on patient stability).\nReverse Trendelenburg\nReverse Trendelenburg positioning (head of bed up, spine straight) can help offload abdominal pressure\ncontributing to increased thoracic pressure.  This can be extremely helpful maneuver to improve\npulmonary compliance in obese patients and/or those with intra -abdominal hypertension.\nSecretion Management Considerations\n1) Increased secretions and mucous plugging of the bronchial tree are extremely common causes for\nincreased oxygen requirement an d difficulty with ventilation in patients with severe respiratory\nfailure from lung infections.\n2) Anecdotal evidence regarding COVID -19 patients suggests that secretions are problematic in some\npatients .  Additionally, in -line suction (closed system) devices  that minimize aerosol formation and\nde-recruitment are not usually available in austere settings.\n3) Heated humidification prevents desiccation (drying out) of secretions and promotes ciliary\nclearance.\n Heated- humidification devices are designed to be used a long with ventilators\n(e.g. , Hamilton H900).\n Heat -Moisture Exchangers (HME) are supplies that fit in-line with the ventilator tubing and trap\nheat and moisture within the circuit.\n HME  Filters (HME -F) are supplies that fit in- line with the ventilator tubing and provide HME and\nmicrobiologic filtration.\n4) Pharmacologic treatment for secretions generally falls into one of three categories:  mucolytics\n(break up mucous), bronchodilators, or anti -sialagogues (anti -salivation) .\n Mucolytics:\n Pre-treat with for 10-15 minutes .\n 20% N -acetylcystine (Mucomyst) as 1 -2mL direct instillation into ETT every 6 hours as\nneeded for secretion control.\n 3% Saline (Hypertonic Saline) as 5mL direct instillation into the ETT every 6 hours as needed for secretion control .\n Bronchodilato rs:  Albuterol will help dry up secretions.  While ultimately decreasing secretion\nvolume, bronchodilators  may also increase the risk of a mucous plug formation.  Use with\ncaution.\n Anti-Sialagogues:  Has the greatest  effect on oral secretions with modest e ffect on pulmonary\nsecretions (and therefore not routinely recommended for COVID -19 patients).  However,\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  21 antisialagogues such as scopolamine and glycopyrrolate are often effective at attenuating the\nincreased secretions caused by high dose ketamine.\n5) Percus sive chest physiotherapy is often provided by respiratory t herapists in Role 3 facilities to\nfacilitate secretion clearance.  Manual (with hands) or mechanical (with percussive physical therapy\ndevices) can be used to create the same effect.\nAdjunctive Str ategies for Severe ARDS\n1) There is no single right answer as to which strategies should be used in severe ARDS.  Each approach\nmay or may not be feasible due to the resource constraints of the austere environment.\nIf unfamiliar with these techniques, obtai n teleconsultation.\n2) Pressure Control –  may include Inverse Ratio Ventilation (PC -IRV):\na. EMV+  731 with the most recent software package has the capability to do PC -IRV.  While using\nAC-P mode, PC -IRV is achieved by increasing the Inspiratory -to-Expiratory (I :E) ratio above 1:2\n(i.e. 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and higher).\nb. PC-IRV cannot fully approximate Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV), but is still the best\navailable salvage mode using EMV+  731.\nc. Once PEEP is maximized (or limited by peak inspiratory pressure) a nd oxygenation is still not yet\nat goal, increase the I:E ratio incrementally.\nd. Tidal volume goal remains the same as with conventional ventilation; adjust cycle time (60/RR)\nto optimize minute ventilation.\ne. Higher I:E ratios are not physiologic, so PC -IRV w ill likely require increased depth of sedation for\npatient comfort and synchrony.\n3) Paralysis for Patient -Ventilator Synchronization\na. Adequate depth of sedation is essential prior to starting a paralyzing medication; recommend RASS greater than -2.\nb. SCCM and DoD COVID-19 Practice Management Guide\nrecommend intermittent paralytics over\ncontinuous infusions, if possible.  Continuous infusion can result in pr olonged paralysis if not\nclosely monitored, especially if muscle twitch monitor is not available.\nc. Paralysis with Vecuronium:\n Bolus: 5mg to 10mg every 60-90 minutes as needed.\n Infusion: 0.8 to 1.2mcg/kg/min (approx. 80mcg/min for 80kg).\n Without pump: 40mg v ecuronium in 250mL bag (50mL wasted) of normal saline yields\n40mg/250mL = 160mcg/mL.  For 80mcg/min = 0.5mL/min ~ 1gt every 12 seconds in 10gt\ntubing.\nd. Monitoring Goal:\n Absence of muscle movement and no evidence of spontaneous breathing on the ventilator.\nIf possible, titrate to 2/4 TOF (testing device likely only available for surgical teams).\n Increased HR and BP may suggest inadequate sedation and should be empirically treated by\nincreasing sedation.\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  22  Once the patient is stabilized, consider holding the pa ralytic at least once every 24 hours to\nprovide for assessment of sedation depth.\n DO NOT hold sedation until paralytic wears off unless absolutely necessary (e.g. , sudden\nhypotension).\n4) Prone Positioning\na. “Awake Self -Proning” with high flow nasal cannula devices has been successfully used in\npatients with moderate to severe COVID -19 lung disease.  If patients are unable to tolerate\nprone positioning (i.e. strong desire to remain in a tripod position), DO NOT force them into the\nprone position.\nb. Reference DoD COVID-19 Practice Management Guide  for full details on prone positioning\nprecautions and procedures.\nc. Placement of either a central line or additional peripheral access is strongly encouraged PRIOR\nto prone positioning.\nd. Have push -dose vasopressor medication available during the process of prone positioning and\nun-positioning, as hypotension frequently occurs.\ne. Proning cycle is generally 16 hours of prone positioning each 24 hours.  Match the proning\ncycle to the daily care plan as much as possible.\nf. Prone positioning may not be feasible or safe during evacuation .\nAnticipate Complications\n1) Pneumothorax can occur with higher PIP.  Sudden increases in PIP and/o r hemodynamic instability\nmay indicate  pneumothorax.\n2) Pneumomediastinum with subcutaneous emphysema can also develop with the use of high PEEP\n(typically from dissection of air into the adventitia o f small bronchi/bronchioles).  The development\nof crepitus across the chest, neck, and/or upper extremities suggests th e presence of this condition.\nTension physiology from pneumomediastinum is EXCEEDINGLY rare and usually no intervention is\nneeded.\n3) Acute kidney injury  leading to renal failure is a genuine threat  to seriously ill COVID -19 patients.\nPatients unable to make urine can develop fatal arrhythmias from electrolyte abnormalities and acidotic blood.  They need to be evacuated to a location capable of renal replacement therapy  as\nsoon as possible.\na. Oliguria  is defined as less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour of urine output (UOP).\nb. Oliguric patients should receive a bolus of 500 cc crystalloid.  This may be repeated once if UOP\ndoes not improve.  If the patient remains oliguric after a 1L bolus , consider the onset of acut e\ntubular necrosis (ATN), especially if UOP remains low for more than 6 hours.\nc. As formal creatinine testing for acute kidney injury (AKI) is not likely to be available, consider urine dipstick testing with attention to specific gravity, proteinuria, and hematuria:\n An abnormally low (dilute) specific gravity in the setting of oliguria suggests tubular damage\nand the inability to concentrate urine.\n Significant proteinuria can be seen in ATN; however, this is not specific and can be seen in a variety of ac ute medical conditions .\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  23  Hematuria may suggest the presence of myoglobinuria –  consider rhabdomyolysis as a\ncause of acute kidney injury .\nd. If UOP suddenly declines or stops, flushing the Foley and/or performing a bladder ultrasound\nscan can help determine if  the problem is mechanical (Foley blockage) or organic (true kidney\ninjury).\ne. Once ATN sets in, do not aggressively fluid resuscitate or diurese  simply to meet UOP goals.\nUse alternative markers of fluid responsiveness (like blood pressure response to pass ive straight\nleg raise) to help determine the need for further fluids and vasopressor medications.\nf. Monitor closely for the development of electrolyte disturbances, specifically metabolic acidosis\nand hyperkalemia.  Use medical  management of hyperkalemia as appropriate.  The JTS CPG on\nHyperkalemia and Dialysis in the Deployed Setting  describes field -expedient techniques for\nperitoneal dialysis; however, this should be done in concert with tel econsultation.\nHemodynamics & Monitoring\n1) An IV pump is  recommend ed over dial-a -flow and drip -chamber titration (if available).\n2) When outdoors, plac e the monitor, ventilator, and IV pumps upwind and as far away as possible\nfrom the patient to minimize contamination  of caregivers .\n3) Establish arterial line  monitoring early  when possible for patients with severe COVID -19 disease as\nthey often become hemodynamically unstable.\n4) If possible, establish central access early in anticipation of the need for continuous va sopressors.\nMultiple peripheral IVs may also be needed for infusions of sedatives, analgesia, antibiotics, etc.\n5) A conventional central venous catheter can be placed through an introducer catheter (i.e. Cordis) to expand the number of available infusion po rts.  This should be done during the initial insertion\nunder sterile technique, if possible.\n6) Some severely ill COVID -19 patients may develop  dilated cardio -myopathy with florid cardiogenic\nshock.  This may be secondary to systemic inflammation, stress, or a direct viral myocarditis.\nPatients may also develop arrhythmias.  Manage arrhythmias following Red Cross advanced life support  guidelines.\n7) An unexpected change in the vital sign trends or hypotension out of proportion to sedation and PEEP should merit e valuation for additional causes of shock.  Limited transthoracic\nechocardiography may be useful in discriminating between hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and\ndistributive shock (in personnel trained to perform the assessment).\n8) Utilize dynamic parameters (i.e. sk in temperature, capillary refilling time, pulse pressure variation,\nblood pressure response to passive straight leg raise, and/or serum lactate measurement) over\nstatic parameters to help guide the need for further fluid resuscitation  (\nSurviving Sepsis Campaign\nCOVID -19 Guidelines ).\n9) Norepinephrine is the  first line vasopressor for most causes of shock.  Fixed rate vasopressin\ninfusion (0.04 units/min) is useful as an early adju nct in non -cardiogenic shock; start vasopressin\nwhen norepinephrine reaches doses above 12mcg/min.  Epinephrine is sometimes the only option available in remote locations.\n10) Vasopressors should be titrated to a MAP goal of 60 - 65 mm Hg. (\nSurviving Sepsis Campaign COVID -\n19 Guidelines .)\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  24 Continued C are & Prophylaxis\n1) Nasogastric or orogastric tube (NG/OGT) should be placed early for gastrointestinal decompression.\nIf medical evacu ation is significantly delayed (greater than 24 -48 hours), consider starting enteral\nnutrition.\n2) Enteral nutrition is contraindicated in hemodynamically unstable patients (i.e. those on high or\nincreasing doses of vasopressors).  Low volume tube feeding on patients with stable low doses of\nvasopressors is generally safe.\n3) At a minimum, confirm p osition of gastric  tube  placement with auscultation over both lung fields\nand the abdomen along with aspiration of gastric contents.  Urinalysis test strips for pH may  provide\nan addition method for NG/OGT placement confirmation in patients not on acid suppressive\ntherapy.\n4) Goal 25 -30 kcal/kg/day + 1 -1.2 gm/kg protein; however, this might be difficult, especially in the\nabsence of formal concentrated tube feeds.\n5) Meal sup plement drinks are not sufficient.  For example, one  Muscle Milk Light bottle contains only\n150 kcal and 28  gm protein in 500  mL, which is extremely dilute compared to most tube feeding\nformulations.  This potentially increase extra -vascular lung water (es pecially in the setting of critical\nillness) with minimal benefit to nutritional status.\n6) A more concentrated alternative is to use commercially available protein powder (with similar\ncaloric/protein content per scoop) at 1/4 the recommended concentration a nd mix in a blender until\nno clumps are visible.  Administer in small volume boluses (e.g. , 60mL via Toomey syringe) as\ntolerated every 2 to 4 hours to a goal of 1  gm/kg/day protein content.\n7) Further recommendations for enteral nutrition can be found in JTS CPG for Nutritional Support\nUsing Enteral and Parenteral Methods .\n8) If possible, blood sugar checks should be obtained at least every 6 hours, particularly for those with known diabetes melli tus.\n9) Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis should be given as long as there are no\ncontraindications.  Patients with COVID have demonstrated and increase risk of the formation of\nthrombus formation, therefore it is recommended to administer Lovenox 30 mg SQ twice daily\n(avoid if evidence of renal failure) or 7,5 00 units  heparin SQ every 8 hours.\n10) If pharmacologic prophylaxis is not available, manual ankle plantar/dorsi -flexion range of motion\nexercises and lower extremity massage every two hours.  Consider applying compression stockings if\navailable.  DO NOT use ACE wraps.\n11) Stress -Ulcer Prophylaxis should be given to all intubated patients as long as there are no\ncontraindications.  Famotidine 20  mg IV every 12 hours or 20 mg via NG/OGT twice daily, o r\nconsi der and a proton pu mp inhibitor, if available (i.e.  pantoprazole 40  mg IV daily or omeprazole\nvia NG/OGT daily).\n12) Ventilator Associated Pneumonia prevention bundle applied to the limitations of an austere environment includes:\n Head-of -bed elevation to 30 de grees\n Suction the oropharynx as needed\n Brush teeth every 12 hours , ideally with commercially prepared Chlorhexidine oral care if\navailable.\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  25 13) The JTS CPG for Nursing Interventions in Prolonged  Field Care  provides in -depth discussion of the\nnursing tasks that may be required if medical evacuation is significantly delayed.\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation\nCardiopulmonary arrest is a difficult topic.  Generally speaking , in cases of cardiac arrest,\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) in an austere environment may  not be a wise  use of resources\nunless the etiology for the arrest is rapidly reversible.  Additionally, significant aerosol generation will\ninvariably occur during CPR of a COVID -19 patient .  It is reasonable during a pandemic to establish\nmedical rules of engagement that discourage providers from performing CPR on infected patients.  If CPR is performed, efforts should focus on reducing provider exposure to COVID -19 and prioritizing\nstrateg ies with lower aerosol for mation risk.  (See DoD Covid -19 PMG\n.)\nPatient Evacuation Considerations for Austere Medicine\nEach AOR should develop its own plan for categorizing COVID -19 patients (for the purposes of isolation\nand evacuation) based on guidance found in DoD policy.\nMedical Evacuation\nMedical Evacuation using MedCon levels described in Appendix A  is one example.\n1) Patient m ovement should be anticipated for COVID -19 PUIs categorized as MedCon 2 or higher.\nThere is no reason to delay notification request for evacuation.\n2) Ground and Air Medical Transport will depend on local CASEVAC/MEDEVAC notification plan and\nCASEVAC /MEDEVAC platforms available for transport.\n3) When clinically and operationally feasible and within the provider’s scope of practice, obtain central venous access in anticipation of need for multiple infusions, including vasopressors, during\ntransport.  Obtain at least two peripheral IV’s or one peripheral plus one central line access prior to\ntransport, if possible.\n4) Early placement of arterial line for invasive pressure monitoring is recommended, if available.\n5) If there is evidence or suspicion for acute co ronary syndrome or myocarditis, coordinate the medical\nmanagement via teleconsultation prior to transport, if possible.\n6) Patients requiring >3 Lpm oxygen support to maintain oxygen saturations >93% may not tolerate the hypoxic environment of aeromedical ev acuation even with cabin altitude restrictions:\na. Given concerns surrounding risk associated with procedures done emergently during transport, consider the need  endotracheal intubation  prior to transport .\nb. The most experienced provider should perform the pro cedure to secure the airway.  Use a video\nlaryngoscope (if available) and rapid sequence induction.\nc. Minimize people in the room during the procedure.  Verify all staff have the best available PPE .\n(See Appendix B\n.)\nd. Consider con sulting the Advanced Critical Care Evacuation Team (ACCET) DSN 312 -429-BURN\n(2876) before transporting patients on moderate to high ventilator settings (PEEP > 14 and FiO 2\n> 70%).  Refer to JTS CPG for Acute Respiratory Failure .\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  26 e. If prone ventilation is to be utilized in-flight, it should be initiated on the ground with adequate\ntime to document patient stability before transport.\n7) If intubated, an NG/OGT should be placed pre -flight and attache d to intermittent suction.\n8) Pre-drawn and pre- mixed medications with primed tubing are examples of time saving measures to\nbe optimized on the patient prior to transport.\n9) Prepare patient records for handoff including medical notes, ECGs, laboratory results , and imaging\nresults (if available).\n10) Prepare patient belongings and ID/passport to accompany the patient.\n11) Place PPE for flight on patient including eye protection and ear protection, and DO NOT forget face covering if not intubated.\nTransition of Care for  Evacuation\n1) Early patient reporting allows  the evacuation team to prepare.\na. The sending facility medical team should provide contact information (if possible) .\nb. The evacuation team should contact the sending facility prior to mission (if possible) .\n2) Handoff t o the transport team should include:\na. Up-to-date COVID -19 testing status (PUI vs confirmed) .\nb. Current vital signs, exam findings, and recent trends or changes .\nc. Current medication regimen if initiated (including antibiotics and anticoagulants) .\nd. Critical care medication regimen (sedation, analgesia, paralysis, and vasopressors) .\ne. Current PPE status, oxygen requirements and ventilator settings .\nf. Any potential COVID -19 related complications identified during management (e.g.,  heavy\nrespiratory secretions) .\n3) Upon eva cuation team arrival to receive the patient, handoff report should be repeated with key\nelements above, including any recent patient changes.\n4) Transition to the evacuation team monitoring and support equipment will present risk of exposure to healthcare te am.  In an attempt to mitigate this risk, consider the following:\na. Personnel should be limited to those directly involved in the care of the patient .\nb. Best available PPE should be worn by everyone involved in the care transition.\nc. ETT clamping technique shoul d be instituted to limit aerosol creation during all ventilator circuit\nbreaks including transfer to evacuation team ventilator .\nd. Sufficient time should be allotted to confirm adequate oxygenation and ventilation prior to departure of the evacuation team.\nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  27 Establishing a Plan for Telemedicine Consultation\n1) Regional Medical Operations Cell should prospectively publish local and regional PACE (Primary-\nAlternate -Contingency -Emergency) plans for both operational and clinical consultation.  Forward-\nstationed medica l teams should test these options PRIOR to needing urgent consultation.\n2) Make use of telehealth resources such as the ADVISOR line ( 866-972-9966, or 833-238-7756), that\nincludes the Virtual Critical Care Consultation (VC3) service.  The ADVISOR program is s pecifically\ndesigned for operational virtual health support.  Additionally, many VC3 consultants have deployed\nto remote locations and can help work through the unique problems faced in austere settings.\nAdditional information on ADVISOR can be obtained b y emailing dod.advisor_office@mail.mil .\n3) Alternatively, contact the following MEDCENs and ask for the on -call critical care staff:\nLandstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany.

2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 Intended Scope and Audience   \nThis guideline is intended for  the provider operating in an austere , limited resource setting .  Providers \nhave varying levels  of knowledge, training,  and experience in basic critical care concepts.  It is not \nintended to be all inclusive, but to spur further thinking and identify areas where r esource limitations or \nknown disease s specif y changes to usual practices .  The management strategy described is designed for \na 24-hour hold of a single critically ill patient and is tailored to the equipment and medications typically \navailable in austere  operational  settings ( Role 1 and Expeditionary Role 2 ).  Refer to the most updated \nDoD COVID-19 Practice Management Guide  for recommended clinical man agement, and CENTCOM \nCOVID -19 Playbook for operational considerations.  \nGuiding Principles  \n1) Our primary mission remains the same.   We must maintain the ability to provide damage control \nresuscitation and surgery in support of combat operations . \n2) Prevention o f disease  transmission to medical personnel is a mission critical consideration for \naustere teams as there is generally very limited skill redundancy.  \n3) Primary capability limitations  may  include manpower, oxygen supply, ventilators, medications, and \nperson al protective equipment (PPE).  \n4) Care of the critically ill COVID -19 patient is primarily supportive medical care plus appropriate \ndisease transmission precautions.  \n5) Use of telemedicine to push critical care expertise as far forward as possible should be part  of the \noperational plan.  \nKey Assumptions  \n1) Most providers operating in austere locations have equipment geared towards combat casualty \ncare, not  necessarily  care for patients in severe respiratory failure.  \n2) Oxygen supply is generally limited to a few portabl e oxygen tanks  and oxygen concentrators not \ndesigned to provide high volume oxygen support . \n3) Laboratory and radiologic evaluation capabilities are generally limited  to non -existent.  \n4) Local and international supply lines have been significantly affected by COVID -19, with reduced \nresupply or  delivery of disease specific supplies  (e.g. , testing kits and viral filters ). \n5) Time to medical evacuation may  be significantly prolonged given the global nature of this crisis , \nlockdown over sovereign airspaces,  and the need  to limit impact to military air assets.  \n6) Most austere locations consist of relatively small camps  (usually less than 100- 300 personnel ) with \nprimarily younger, healthier population s.  However, some personnel may fall into high risk \ncategories.  As such, based upon current epidemiology,  planning should account for  1-3 critically ill \npatients at each austere location.  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 ( ID:85) 23 Apr 2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 Key Definitions  \n1) Quarantine :  Separation and restriction of movement (ROM) for personnel  potentially exposed to a \ncontagious disease but withou t symptoms of illness.  These personnel  may have been exposed to a \ndisease and do not know it, or they may have the disease but do not show symptoms.  This is a \ncommand function that is medically supported.  \n2) Isolation :  Separation of sick personnel  with a confirmed contagious disease or high index of \nsuspicion (i.e. person under investigation) from people who are not sick.  This is a medical function requiring command support . \n3) Person  Under Investigation (PUI):   A patient with signs and symptoms consistent wi th COVID -19 \ninfection and possible exposure to the virus.  In areas where COVID -19 is already widespread, \nsymptoms alone may make the diagnosis of “PUI.”  All PUIs must be isolated.  \n4) Contact Spread:  Spread of disease via direct contact with an infected pat ient or contaminated \nsurface.  Contact precautions aim to mitigate this method of transmission. \n5) Droplet Spread:  Spread of disease via relatively large liquid particles that settle from the air\n, \ntypically within a few feet .  Droplet precautions aim to miti gate this method of transmission. \n6) Airborne Spread:  Spread of disease via small liquid particles (aerosols) that remain aloft for \nprolonged periods of time and may travel longer distances.  Airborne precautions aim to mitigate \nthis method of transmission. \nKey References  \n1) Alhazzani W, Hylander M, Arabi Y, et al.

Tracheal Intubation  \nb. Extubation (accidental or planned)  \nc. Bag-Valve Mask Ventilation \nd. Any disconnection of the ventila tor circuit  \ne. Tracheal suctioning without in -line suction device  \nf. Tracheostomy (and Cricothyroidotomy)  \ng. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation \nLevels of PPE  \nLevels are based upon risk o f disease and risk of procedure .   \nNOTE :  the patient should wear a basic facemask ( cloth or otherwise) whenever feasible to provide an \nadditional barrier.  \nMinimum :  Face covering, eye protection glasses, gloves, and makeshift gown.   \nNOTE: F or patients with low probability of disease and where direct contact with the patient is low, \ngown s may not be required (mirroring conventional droplet precautions).  \nBetter :  Surgical mask or N95 mask, face shield (either standalone or with mask) and eye protection, \ngloves, gown (surgical or contact), head covering.  \nBest :  N95 mask (with or without sur gical mask covering) with face shield and disposable head covering \nor hooded face shield (e.g. , Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives ( CBRNE)  \npro-mask) along with gown and gloves.  \nConservation of PPE  \n1) COVID -19 can survive on  various surfaces for up to 72 hours or longer.  \n2) Use cloth face covering when risk is low to conserve supply of surgical face masks and N95 masks \nneeded for high risk procedures (e.g.,  endotracheal intubation).  \n3) Doff PPE in a manner that allows for it to be easily donned again without contacting contaminated \nsurfaces (if possible).  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  8 4) For re -use of surgical face masks or N95 masks: while wearing gloves, store the mask in a paper bag \nin a dry, shaded/indoor area for 72 hours  prior to using again.  DO NOT use blea ch or UV radiation \n(i.e. sunlight) to ‘sterilize’ the N95 –  this will degrade mask effectiveness.  \n5) Eye protection glasses and face shields should be cleaned with a diluted bleach solution between \nuses.  \nMask Recommendations  \nU.S. National Institute for Occup ational Safety and Health recommends the following for extended use \nand re-use of N95 respirators:  \n1) N95 masks maintain their effectiveness for at least 8  hours  of continuous or intermittent use. \n2) N95 masks should be discarded following aerosol generating pro cedures (e.g.,  endotracheal \nintubation) or when visibly contaminated with bodily fluids.  \n3) Consider using a large face shield that sits in front of the mask, wear a surgical mask over -top of the \nN95, or masking the patient to minimize contamination. \n4) Perform hand hygiene with soap and water or an alcohol -based hand sanitizer before and after \ntouching or adjusting the mask.  \nQuarantine (Asymptomatic Personnel with Identified Exposure)  \n1) While separate berthing for quarantined individuals is optimal, living space is generally limited in austere settings.  As such, berthing with individual rooms should provide adequate protection to allow quarantined individuals to remain in their room.  \n2) Individuals placed on quarantine per CDC screening guidelines are instructed to s tay in their room \nand conduct self -observation for the development of any symptoms. \n3) Teammates should check on the status of the quarantined individual several times daily and bring them food, water, and comfort items as needed.  \n4) Social distancing is strictl y enforced when the individual needs to use the bathroom for toilet and \nhygiene.  They should not use the gym, MWR, or any other common areas while under quarantine.  \n5) Depending on risk to force and mission requirements, mission critical personnel (including  medical \npersonnel) could be allowed to work ( face covering, N -95 if possible, otherwise a cloth mask may be \nused) .  Early engagement of nonmedical leadership in such decision making is essential.  \nIsolation (Symptomatic Personnel)  \n1) PUI may not  leave isolati on berthing unless instructed to do so by medical personnel.  \n2) When outside of the isolation berthing, PUI will be required to wear a cloth face covering and clean \nhands with soap and water or alcohol based hand sanitizer.  \n3) No visitors allowed within the isolation berthing.  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 ( ID:85) 23 Apr 2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9 Initial Medical Evaluation  \n1) Pre-designate a provider as the COVID provider.  This provider should perform all evaluations and \nprocedures to limit exposure to other medical personnel, if possible.  Remember, maintaining \ncombat casualty care capability is still the priority .  Balance the provider skillset and experience with \npotential impact on medical support for combat operations.  The designated provider may not be \nthe most experienced provider, but can consult with teammates as needed for management, \nprocedures, and nursing care. \n2) All patients presenting to sick call with any complaint should be screened for typical COVID -19 \nsymptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, gastrointestinal complaints) and risk of exposure.  \n3) If PUI presents to a provider other than the designated COVID attending provider, the patient should \nbe provided a cloth face covering (or surgical mask) and escorted to pre -designated COVID \ntreatment area.  \n4) If possible, all evaluations and treatment of PUI should be done outside the combat  casualty care \nfacility to mitigate potential for contamination of the facility.  \n5) Medical personnel performing the evaluation should wear the best available PPE (see Appendix B ) \nbalancing the supply of PPE with the threat of pat ient interaction.  \n6) Examination should include full vital signs including pulse oximetry, work of breathing assessment, \npulmonary auscultation, skin temperature, and capillary refill.  \nAncillary  Tests  \nMinimum : Rapid Malaria Testing (if febrile in malaria ende mic region)  \nBetter  (Above +):  \n 12-Lead ECG  \n Rapid Flu Testing  \n Rapid Dengue Testing  \n I-STAT  arterial blood gas or venous blood gas  \n Ultrasound (cardiac and pulmonary)  \nBest  (Above +):  \n PA and LAT Chest Films  \n Respiratory Pathogen Film Array (i.e. Biofire)  \n COVID -19 PCR Testing  \n Other laboratory testing listed DoD COVID19 Practice Management Guide  \nIdentifying Patients at Risk for Deterioration:  \n1) Among patients with mild to moderate symptoms and normal resting pulse oximetry, the risk of \ndeterioration is increased in those presenting with dyspnea, desaturation on exercise testing, and \nepidemiologic risk factors for severe disease (age over 50, cardiovascular dise ase, pulmonary \ndisease, immunosuppressive medications).  These patients should be monitored closely and \nconsidered for early evacuation.  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  10 2) Exercise (Walk) Test : Have the patient jog or walk in place for 3 minutes.  Inability to complete the \ntest or desaturat ion below SpO 2 <94% confers a higher risk for clinical deterioration.  This is a triage \ntest used by several New York hospitals during the pandemic to help gauge the need for closer \nmonitoring.  \nConsideration of Alternative Diagnoses  \n1) If a patient with sympt oms possibly consistent with COVID -19 has known risk for or exposure to \nCOVID -19, the patient should be managed as a PUI regardless of the differential diagnosis.  This does \nnot mean that alternative and/or comorbid diagnoses are impossible as COVID -19 pat ients can be \nco-infected with other pathogens.  \n2) Life threatening alternative diagnoses (e.g. , pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, acute myocardial \ninfarction, etc.) should always be considered and managed according to standard practices for diagnosis and trea tment.  \nTesting in Austere Locations  \n1) Most austere locations will be unable to test for COVID -19 using an approved polymerase chain \nreaction  (PCR) assay.  However, if testing does become available, the following should be \nconsidered:  \n The false negative rate for COVID -19 PCR assay is likely to be significant enough to merit a \nminimum period of isolation (or quarantine) regardless of test result.  \n Testing priority should be guided by the CDC priority for testing balanced against operational priorities.  For exam ple, a patient with mild symptoms and no risk factors for decompensation \nmay not warrant immediate testing.  However, if combatant command determines that the individual is mission critical, the testing may be considered a higher priority.  \n2) Given significan t resource constraints in an austere environment (specifically the limited duration of \noxygen supply, medication supply, and limited quantity of PPE) coordination for evacuation to the \nappropriate level of care should be initiated as soon as possible, even  if the patient does not \nnecessarily need urgent evacuation as it may take more than 24 hours to execute an evacuation mission.  This underscores the importance for early evacuation coordination while simultaneously planning for prolonged care. \n3) Appendix A\n describes a tiered Medical Condition (MedCon) flowchart developed for standardization \nof terminology across an area of responsibility ( AOR ) and between medical providers, medical \nplanners, and operational leadership.  \nIsolation Billeting Location Considerations  \n1) Most austere locations have group billet ing with shared ventilation, making the practice of ‘self -\nisolation’ impractical.  While individual billeting with separated bathrooms is optimal, patient \nisolation cohorts may be th e best option available with limited space.  \n2) Billeting should be able to expand to hold multiple patients of varying severity and allow adequate \ncomfort for all patient categories (mild, moderate, and severe illness).  \n3) Billeting ventilation (i.e. environment al control units) should face away from any gathering areas \nand common walkways. \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  11 4) Billeting entrances should be well marked (e.g. , “Isolation Area -  No Unauthorized Access!”)  \nand include posted guides on proper PPE procedures.  \n5) Consider location relative to  bathrooms and areas traversed to get to the bathrooms.  If available, \ndesignate bathrooms for isolated patients only.  If there is engineering support, a pit toilet can be \nconstructed.  Disposable water bottles can be used as urinals.  \n6) Consider designating a critical care area within or near the isolation area separate f rom the main \nmedical facility/ aid station.  Additionally, consider the route that must be traversed in order to \ntransport the patient to an evacuation platform.  The focus should be, as much  as possible, on \npreserving the ability to provi de combat casualty care, if needed.  \n7) If confirmatory testing is available, considering cohorting isolated patients by positive test vs. \nuntested or negative test to avoid needlessly infecting PUIs who do not i n-fact have COVID -19. \nPreparation of Isolation Billeting \n1) Do not move PUI into isolation billeting before preparation is complete . \n2) All non -isolated personnel occupying the space must vacate the building . \n3) Allow PUI (while wearing a surgical mask) to gather p ersonal belongings from lodging and move into \nisolation berthing.  \na. Personal hygiene items  \nb. Bed sheets and clothing  \nc. Electronic devices + chargers  \n4) If PUI is unable to retrieve items, personnel with mask + gloves (at minimum) should retrieve any \nessential items . \n5) Basic medical items remain in isolation billet ing at all times: \na. Oral t hermometer with box of sheaths  \nb. Pulse oximeter(s)  \nc. Alcohol based hand sanitizer  \nd. Stethoscope(s)  \ne. Manual blood pressure cuff(s)  \nf. Box of surgical masks  \ng. 14 day supply of Acetaminophen , ibuprof en and cold/flu medicine as available.  \n6) PPE Box (for providers, prepositioned outside isolation berthing):  \na. Min 3 g owns (either surgical or yellow contact precaution gowns)  \nb. Min 3 N95 masks  \nc. Min 6 s urgical masks  \nd. Min 3 face shields and/or cleaned eyepro  \ne. Min 3 s urgical caps or bouffant caps  \nf. Box of gloves  \ng. Tub of disinfectant wipes  \nh. Spray bottle of dilute bleach  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  12 i. Paper towels (for cleaning)  \nj. Trash bags  \n7) Life Support Items  \na. Hydration:  Water bottles, juice containers, Gatorade, etc.  \nb. Food: MREs, meal supplement drinks, sn acks, etc.  Provide hot -meals as able.  \nc. Hygiene :  Box of wet wipes.  Encourage use of portable urinals (e.g. , empty water bottles).  If the \nbathroom must be shared with non -isolated personnel or if a designated bathroom traverses \ncommon areas, the PUI shoul d be escorted by personnel wearing PPE while themselves wearing \na mask.  The escort will instruct anyone inside the bathroom to vacate prior to use.  All surfaces \nused by the PUI must be cleaned with dilute bleach solution.  \nd. Trash:  Small trash receptacle w ith bag inside isolation berthing.  Large receptacle double \nbagged will be placed immediately outside the isolation berthing.  Biohazard s ign will be placed \non top.  Only medical personnel or designated non -essential/non -high risk personnel will \ndispose of  this trash to minimize risk to others.  PUI will be instructed to tie off small bags and \nplace in a large container daily.  Consider the local population access to trash and dispose \nfollowing approved policy for biohazardous waste.  \nContinued Monitoring Co nsiderations for Personnel in  Outpatient  Isolation  \n1) Maintain communication with personnel in isolation.  The attending  COVID provider will determine \nthe need for more frequent assessments.  \n2) Once a patient meets MedCon2 criteria or higher, continuous monitori ng is recommended as their \nrisk of rapid decompensation rises significantly . (MedCon2: Progressive symptoms that are \nconcerning based upon provider clinical judgment. See Appendix A .) \n3) The Prolonged Field Care flowsheet  provides  a framework for recording frequent assessments and \ninterventions . (See JTS Documentation in Prolonged Field Care CPG .) \n4) Consider using video chat (e.g.,  WhatsApp) to obtain vital signs and perform visual assessment of \npatient to minimize exposure in MedCon1 .  (MedCo n1: Mild flu -like symptoms, SpO2 >94% on room \nair, hemodynamically normal.  See Appendix A .)  Patients can t ake their own pulse oximetry reading \nand temperature at pre-determined intervals or cohort patients in isolation billet ing can do it for \neach other.  \n5) If concerning symptoms develop, the COVID attending provider performs an in -person exam using \nthe best avai lable PPE.  \nCommand and Control Considerations  \n1) Notification of both medical and operational leadership is imperative and should occur soon after identification of a PUI.  \n2) Official notification in an approved format should be drafted and submitted to the command \nsurgeon (or appropriate designee).  \n3) If MedCon2 or higher risk category, begin coordination for evacuation to a higher echelon of care as \nsoon as possible.  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  13 4) Identify potential close contacts of PUI, screen for symptoms, and manage according to CDC \nguideli nes for high risk exposure. \nPerformance Improvement Measures  \nPopulation of Interest  \nAll hospitalized patients who are COVID -19 positive (includes confirmed and presumptive cases when \ntesting is not available).  \nIntent (Expected Outcomes)  \n1) Initial presenting symptoms are documented in the population of interest.  \n2) Co-morbidities are documented in the population of interest.  \n3) COVID test sample collection and result times are documented in the population of interest.  \n4) When intubation is required, staff  document levels of use (level 1 -surgical mask, level 2 -N95, level 3 - \nPowered air -purifying respirator ( PAPR) ). \n5) Recommended treatments for severe and critical COVID -19 patients are received early after hospital \nadmission. \nPerformance/Adherence Metrics  \n1) Number and percent age of patients with initial presenting symptoms  are documented in the h istory  \nand physical (H&P ) record . \n2) Number and percentage of patients with a complete past medical history ( PMH ) are documented in \nthe H&P.  \n3) Number and percentage of patients with smoking history are documented in the H&P.  \n4) Document ed number and percentage of patients with COVID test sample collection and result \ntimes.  \n5) Number and percentage of patients requiring intubation procedures  who have documentation of \nlevel of PPE used by staff (lev el 1-surgical mask, level 2 -N95, level 3 -PAPR).  \n6) Number and percentage of severe and critical patients receiving remdesivir in < 24 hrs and < 48 hrs.  \n7) Number and percentage of severe and critical patients receiving dexamethasone in < 24 hrs and < 48 hrs. \n8) Number and percentage of severe and critical patients receiving COVID convalescent plasma  (CCP)  \nin < 24 hrs and < 48 hrs.  \nData Source  \n Patient Record  \n DoDTR  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  14 System  Reporting &  Frequency  \n The previous  sections constitute the minimum criteria for PI monitoring of this CPG.  System \nreporting will be performed annually; additional PI monitoring and system reporting may be \nperformed as needed.  \n The JTS Chief, JTS Program Manager, and the JTS PI Branch will perform the system review and \ndata analysis.  \nResponsibilities  \nIt is the trauma team leader’s responsibility to ensure familiarity, appropriate compliance , and PI \nmonitoring at the local level with this CPG.  \nProviding Med ical Care to a COVID -19 PUI \nOxygen Supply Considerations  \n(See Appendix  F) \n1) Take inventory of the equipment and supplies available at your treatment facility.  Important items \ninclude small oxygen concentrators (SAROSTM), oxygen cylinders (D -cylinders and H- cylinders), and \noxygen generating systems (POGS and EDOCS).   \n2) Identif y the closest resource capable of filling oxygen cylinders.  This may be a military biomedical \nmaintenance team or host nation industrial gas supply company.  \n3) If you locate empty oxygen cylinders, begin the process  of filling them right away.  You will likely \nconsume them quickly if you get a very seriously ill COVID -19 patient.  \n4) Develop a resupply plan for your oxygen cylinders.  A very seriously ill COVID -19 patient will rapidly \ndeplete oxygen supplies.  \n If your facility has the capability to fill oxygen cylinders, then develop a plan to refill tanks.  Identify someone not directly involved in patient care since tank refill and patient care may need to occur simultaneously.  \n If your facility does not have the capability to refill oxygen cylinders, then develop a re-supply \nplan.  One option is to coordinate medical cylinder exchange in conjunction with MEDEVAC missions.  \n5) The SAROS\nTM oxygen concentrator can provide up to 3 Lpm of 100% O 2.  However, when unplugged, \nbattery will only last 30 minutes on continuous fl ow. \n6) SAROSTM can be daisy -chained together to provide higher flow, approximating 5 -6 Lpm.  A suction \nY-connector can be used to connect several together.  \n7) Ventilators waste less oxygen when using a high pressure hose.  A full D -cylinder providing 15 Lpm \nof O 2 via disposable oxygen tubing will last 20 -30 minutes.  The same D -cylinder providing 100% FiO 2 \nthrough a ventilator connected via green high pressure hosing will last 30 -45 minutes (depending on \nminute ventilation).  \n8) Reducing minute ventilation (e.g. , sedation with or without  paralysis) and oxygen consumption \n(reduce FiO 2 to absolute minimum to attain SpO 2 88-92%) will extend oxygen supplies.  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  15 9) If transporting patient(s) to an evacuation pick-up site, anticipate delay and bring double the \nestimated oxygen su pply.  \nVentilator Considerations  \n(See Appendix  G, Appendix H and Appendix I) \n1) Minimum requirement for an effective ventilator in severe hypoxic respiratory failure:  \na. Must  be able to provide Positive End- Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) . \nb. Must allow for titration of tidal volume and respiratory rate (control minute ventilation) . \nc. Must be able to provide supplemental oxygen greater than room air (>21% FiO 2). \n2) Commercial full function  ventilators (e.g. , Drager, Puritan -Bennett) may be  available at some \naustere locations and are  the ideal ventilator s to use if available.  These ventilators can perform \nadvanced ventilation strategies and are indicated for treatment of COVID patients.   \nNote :  They are not transport ventilators, as the instruments are sensitive and should remain in an \narea where they can be protected.   Transfer the patient to a transport vent for evacuation.  \n3) The Zoll (Impact)  EMV+ 731 transport ventilator is available in many military equipment sets and \ncertified to function in all aviation environments.  IMPACT 754 ventilators are sufficient, but do not provide Pressure Control -  Inverse Ratio Ventilation capability (discussed below).  \n4) Hamilton T1 transport ventilators pro vide specialized support options, including advanced pressure \ncontrol options and integrated high flow oxygen therapy.  Certified for ground transport and rotary -\nwing transport, but not approved for fixed wing aircraft (pressurized cabin) transport . \n5) SAVe I I rescue ventilators are an option with limited capability:  PEEP only up to 10 cm H\n2O and \nminute ventilation only up to 8 Lpm.  Oxygen reservoir tubing for the air intake is required to provide supplemental oxygen.  If this is the only device available at  your location, arrange transfer to \na location  with more advanced ventilator as soon as possible.  \n6) SAVe I rescue ventilator has no adjustability and cannot provide PEEP.  DO NOT manage critically ill COVID -19 patients with this device.  Manual ventilation w ith a Bag -Valve -Mask (BVM), PEEP valve, \nand supplemental oxygen will be more effective.  \nPersonnel Considerations  \n1) Minimize the number of personnel required to care for the PUI.  Establish a priority list of who will \nbe available to assist.  Ensure that the rest of the team can maintain the combat casualty care \ncapability.  \n2) In cases where evacuation may be delayed, establish work -rest cycles, allowing for adequate time to \nhydrate, eat, and sleep.  This has been shown to reduce PPE waste, minimize provider exha ustion, \nand prevent accidental exposures. \n3) Ambulatory PUIs (“walking wounded”) can potentially assist in monitoring and providing care to more seriously ill patients.  \n4) Consider having someone (not directly involved in patient care) act as a runner.  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  16 Equipment /Supplies  \nThe equipment and supplies needed for the management of a critical ill COVID -19 patient are \nsummarized in Appendix L and Appendix M. \nClinical Care Considerations  \nInitial reports suggest th at among COVID -19 patients who develop critical illness, the rapid decline \ntypically starts about 5 -7 days following the first symptoms.  Closely monitoring these patients during \nthis time period is critical for early intervention.  \nAirway Management  \n1) Minimi ze viral aerosol formation and direct exposure of medical personnel.  \n2) Use the best available PPE for high risk procedures like endotracheal intubation.  (See Appendix B .) \n3) Gauge the need for inserting an advanced airway on the pat ient work of breathing.  COVID -19 \npatients decompensate rapidly – a low threshold for intubation allows more time for preparation \nand may prevent complications. \n4) If the COVID attending provider does not feel comfortable with placing an advanced airway, \ncons ider teleconsultation and/or waiting for arrival of more experienced personnel  \n(e.g. , evacuation team).  Never try to place an advanced airway unless you know how to do it . \n5) One assistant is sufficient  during intubation  in most cases; however, an additional assistant can be \nstanding by in the “warm” zone at least 2 meters away wearing appropriate PPE.  \n6) Passively pre -oxygenate with 100% O 2 for at least 5 minutes.  Consider placing a surgical mask on \nthe patient ( over top of nasal cannula or non -rebreather  mask). \n7) Utilize strict rapid sequence intubation  technique – avoid BVM  ventilation if possible.  If available, \nplace viral filter in-line during use of BVM.  \n8) Utilize video laryngoscopy  (i.e. GlideS cope) if available for intubation to limit direct exposure.  If \nunable to intubate or obtain adequate vocal cord visualization on the first pass, consider the placement of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) with viral filter.  Ventilate with the BVM and PEEP \nvalve until oxygenation is adequate.  Then, re-attempt the procedu re. \n9) Chest X -Ray may not be available or feasible to confirm tube placement.  Utilize  end-tidal carbon \ndioxide (EtCO\n2) monitoring and auscultation to confirm placement. \n10) General guide for tube size and  depth is as follows:  for males use 8.0 endotracheal tube  (ETT) \ninserted to 25cm at the incisors; for females use 7.0 ETT inserted to 23cm at the incisors.   \nIn general, place as large an ETT as possible since secretions may be an issue.  \n11) If available, place heated humidification device (e.g. , Hamilton H900) or heat and moisture \nexchanger (HME) in the INHALATION circuit of the ventilator tubing.  If available, place a HEPA filter \n(microbiological filter) or HME -F (HME plus microbiological filter) in the EXAHALTION circuit of \nventilator tubing.  \nCricothyroidotomy   \nCricothyroidotomy  for definitive airway management: \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  17 1) Many medics and other providers operating independently in far -forward environments are trained \nto use cricothyroidotomy as their primary definitive airway.  While the use of a surgical airway first \nline is appropriate in patients presenting in -extremis or with the loss of an airway (e.g.,  severely \ninjured trauma patients with facial or neck trauma), patients with COVID -19 generally present with \ngradually progressive symptoms and intact native airways.  \n2) Early intra -theater transfer to a facility with advanced capabilities is preferable to early \ncricothyroidotomy whenever possible.  \n3) Laryngeal mask airway or other supraglottic  airway placement may be a sufficient bridge to \ndefinitive airway placement.  Placement  of a mask over the LMA (hole cut in the middle of the mask \nfor the LMA) will minimize aerosol spread from any  air leak.  PEEP above 10 cm H 2O via LMA may \nnot be effective and may exacerbate any leak around the LMA.  Sedation and analgesic \nrequirements for  an LMA may be slightly more than with a cricothyroidotomy. \n4) Cricothyroidotomy without the ability to provide mechanical ventilation consumes significant \nresources (manpower required to bag- ventilate the patient with PEEP, inefficient delivery of oxygen \nvia bag-ventilation, and significant aerosol risk to those providing care).  \nMedication Options  \nSystemic C orticosteroids  \nProfessional societies recommend using  systemic corticosteroids  in the treatment of severe and critical \nCOVID -19 (see the DoD COVID-19 PMG  for more details) .  If unfamiliar with corticosteroid treatment \nregimens, discuss with advanced provider via telehealth prior to initiating therapy.  \nAntimicrobial Therapy  \n(to treat possible bacterial pneumonia co -infection)  \n1) Consider early use of azithromycin (500mg  PO or IV  daily for a minimum of 5 days) to treat mild to \nmoderate community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients with lower respiratory t ract symptoms \nand fever.  \n2) If azithromycin is not available, doxycycline (100mg PO or IV q12h) can be substituted for empiric \ntreatment of bacterial pneumonia.  \n3) For patients with severe symptoms, recommend adding ceftriaxone (IV 2gm q24h is the best option) \nor ampicillin- sulbactam (3gm IV q6hr is a good alternative) or ertapenem (1g IV or IM q24h if it is the \nonly available option).  \n4) Levofloxacin (750mg  PO or IV  q24h) is another reasonable option for empiric treatment of severe \ncommunity -acquired pneumonia.  \nFever M anagement  \nFever management  with acetaminophen every 6 hours (1000mg IV or 975mg PO  or PR) as needed for \ntemperature over 38°C.  \nSedation and Analgesia \n1) Sedation goal is  Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS ) -1 to -2 (comfortable, transiently \nresponsive to verbal stimulation) and synchronous with the ventilator.  Increase sedation and/or \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  18 add narcotics to improve patient-ventilator synchrony.  Use of paralytics may be required for very \nsevere cases (as discussed below).  \n2) Ketamine may cause increased secretions which may require more frequent suctioning.   \nIf medication options are limited, consider more frequent dosing of midazolam to decrease the dose of ketamine required and potentially decrease the secretion burden.  \n3) A reference guide for starting a nd titrating a ketamine drip along with useful adjuncts is provided in \nJTS Ana lgesia and Sedation Management during Prolonged Field Care  CPG\n. \n4) Combined use of multiple sedatives (i.e. propofo l, dexmedetomidine and/or midazolam) may act \nsynergistically to decrease the total sedative dose and help to mitigate the hypotensive effects of propofol , however multiple continuous drips is not recommended outside of an ICU setting.  A \nketamine drip may be combined with bolus doses of additional medications.  \n5) Caution should be used with combining propofol and dexmedetomidine , especially in younger \npatients with higher vagal tone due to increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension. \n6) Intermittent or doses  of fentanyl or hydromorphone may be useful for analgesia and optimizing \nventilator synchrony.  \n7) Low dose vasopressors may be necessary to support hemodynamics in the face of deeper sedation and higher PEEP . (See Appendix D\n.) \nBronch odilation  \n1) Use of metered-dose-inhalers (MDIs) over nebulized bronchodilators  to treat wheezing  will help to \nminimize risk for infectious aerosol.  \n2) If the ventilator tubing does not have a capped inlet for medication administration (aka MDI \nadapter) -- 1) clamp the ETT, 2) disconnect the ventilator, and 3) administer the MDI (6 puffs) \ndirectly into the INHALATION circuit.  Then, reconnect the ventilator and unclamp ETT to insufflate the medication. \n3) Magnesium Sulfate 2gm IV over 20 minutes (similar to treatment of an asthma exacerbation) may be a safer alternative for treatment of bronchospasm given the risks of disconnecting the circuit.  \nRespiratory Care  \nLung- protective ventilation  \n1) Initiate lung- protective ventilation strategy.  \na. Tidal volume 6mL/kg ideal body w eight (IBW)  \n IBW – Men = 50 kg + (2.3 kg x (height in inches - 60)) \n IBW – Women = 45.5 kg + (2.3 kg x (height in inches - 60)) \nb. Maintain peak pressure less than 35  mm Hg \nc. Maintain SpO 2 88-95% or PaO 2 55-80 mm Hg \nd. Permit Hypercarbia (but  keep arterial pH > 7.30 ) \ne. Use ARDSnet protocol . (See Appendix E) \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  19 2) If ETT must be disconnected from the ventilator for ANY reason, clamp the ETT to prevent \ndecruitment and minimize viral aerosol formation.  \n3) If in-line suction devices are not available, de -recruitment will likely occur with suctioning.  Salvage \nrecruitment maneuvers may be necessary.  \n4) On the  EMV+  731  (mode AC -V) a recruitment maneuver can be done as follows:  \na. Change upper limit of Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) alarm to 50  cm H20. \nb. Decrease  tidal v olume as low as possible (50mL) . \nc. Increase PEEP to 30 -40 cm H20. \nd. Hold for 40 seconds (if signs of hemodynamic instability develop, stop the recruitment \nmaneu ver, and resume prior settings) . \ne. Increase PEEP to 2  cm H20 ABOVE prior PEEP setting . \nf. Increas e tidal volume back to prior setting.  \ng. Return upper limit of PIP alarm to prior set ting. \nh. Monitor for any persistence of hemodynamic instability or persistently high PIP (Although rare, \nthe high PIP encountered dur ing RMs can cause pneumothorax) . \n5) Dry Lung.   The mantra “a dry  lung is a happy lung” still applies in severe COVID -19 care; over \nresuscitation is likely to be harmful.  Fluid resuscitation should be guided by assessment of volume \nresponsiveness.  If available and evacuation is significantly delayed, loop diuretics can be used to \nattain a net even volume status, providing the patient is hemodynamically stable  \n(i.e. not requiring vasopressor support).  \nManagement of Oxygenation  \n1) Escalate PEEP to 12  cm H20 as aggressively as possible as hemodynamics allow  to optimize \noxygenation, minimize FiO 2 needs, and extend oxygen supply.  \n2) Use the ARDSNet Protocol LOW PEEP table as a guide for further titration of PEEP.  Refer to JTS Acute Respiratory Failure CPG\n. \n3) Be prepared to start vasopressors and judicious use of IVF to support pre -load in the face of high \nPEEP (aka PEEP tamponade).  \n4) Consider a combination of paralysis and prone positioning early to lengthen duration of available \noxygen supply. \n5) Consider Inverse Ratio Ventilation (IRV) once patient reaches PEEP 18  cm H20 on the LOW PEEP \ntable.  \nManagement of Ventilation  \n1) If blood gas analysis is not available, a general EtCO 2 goal of 35 mm Hg +/ - 5, is adequate.  However, \nif blood gas analysis is available  (i.e. i-STAT ), recommend obtaining a baseline PCO 2 and correlate \nwith EtCO 2, especially since the gradient between the two is much wider in patients with significant \nlung disease (i.e. an EtCO 2 of 40 may actually represent a PCO 2 of 60 with a pH around 7. 24). \n2) The manual breath button on the bottom left of EMV+ 731 allows for manual measurement of \nplateau pressure (Pplat).  The Pplat goal is less than 30  cm H2O with a secondary goal of maintaining \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  20 driving pressure (Pplat minus PEEP) below 15 cm  H2O.  In the  absence of Pplat, a PIP target of less \nthan 35  cm H20 is also reasonable.  \n3) If Pplat is greater than 30  cm H20, decrease set tidal volume by 1 mL/kg steps (about 50 -80 mL).  \nTitrate set respiratory rate (RR) up increments of 2 bpm to maintain pH and EtCO 2 at goal.  Avoid RR \nabove 35 bpm given significant risk for breath stacking and auto PEEP (which will eventually make \nthe patient hemodynamically unstable). \n4) If i-STAT with blood gas cartridges are available, consider serial blood gas evaluation (adjusting \nfrequency depending on patient stability).  \nReverse Trendelenburg  \nReverse Trendelenburg positioning (head of bed up, spine straight) can help offload abdominal pressure \ncontributing to increased thoracic pressure.  This can be extremely helpful maneuver to improve \npulmonary compliance in obese patients and/or those with intra -abdominal hypertension.  \nSecretion Management Considerations  \n1) Increased secretions and mucous plugging of the bronchial tree are extremely common causes for \nincreased oxygen requirement an d difficulty with ventilation in patients with severe respiratory \nfailure from lung infections. \n2) Anecdotal evidence regarding COVID -19 patients suggests that secretions are problematic in some \npatients .  Additionally, in -line suction (closed system) devices  that minimize aerosol formation and \nde-recruitment are not usually available in austere settings.  \n3) Heated humidification prevents desiccation (drying out) of secretions and promotes ciliary \nclearance.  \n Heated- humidification devices are designed to be used a long with ventilators  \n(e.g. , Hamilton H900).  \n Heat -Moisture Exchangers (HME) are supplies that fit in-line with the ventilator tubing and trap \nheat and moisture within the circuit.  \n HME  Filters (HME -F) are supplies that fit in- line with the ventilator tubing and provide HME and \nmicrobiologic filtration.  \n4) Pharmacologic treatment for secretions generally falls into one of three categories:  mucolytics \n(break up mucous), bronchodilators, or anti -sialagogues (anti -salivation) . \n Mucolytics:  \n Pre-treat with for 10-15 minutes . \n 20% N -acetylcystine (Mucomyst) as 1 -2mL direct instillation into ETT every 6 hours as \nneeded for secretion control.  \n 3% Saline (Hypertonic Saline) as 5mL direct instillation into the ETT every 6 hours as needed for secretion control . \n Bronchodilato rs:  Albuterol will help dry up secretions.  While ultimately decreasing secretion \nvolume, bronchodilators  may also increase the risk of a mucous plug formation.  Use with \ncaution.  \n Anti-Sialagogues:  Has the greatest  effect on oral secretions with modest e ffect on pulmonary \nsecretions (and therefore not routinely recommended for COVID -19 patients).  However, \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  21 antisialagogues such as scopolamine and glycopyrrolate are often effective at attenuating the \nincreased secretions caused by high dose ketamine.  \n5) Percus sive chest physiotherapy is often provided by respiratory t herapists in Role 3 facilities to \nfacilitate secretion clearance.  Manual (with hands) or mechanical (with percussive physical therapy \ndevices) can be used to create the same effect.  \nAdjunctive Str ategies for Severe ARDS  \n1) There is no single right answer as to which strategies should be used in severe ARDS.  Each approach \nmay or may not be feasible due to the resource constraints of the austere environment.   \nIf unfamiliar with these techniques, obtai n teleconsultation.  \n2) Pressure Control –  may include Inverse Ratio Ventilation (PC -IRV):  \na. EMV+  731 with the most recent software package has the capability to do PC -IRV.  While using \nAC-P mode, PC -IRV is achieved by increasing the Inspiratory -to-Expiratory (I :E) ratio above 1:2 \n(i.e. 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and higher).  \nb. PC-IRV cannot fully approximate Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV), but is still the best \navailable salvage mode using EMV+  731.  \nc. Once PEEP is maximized (or limited by peak inspiratory pressure) a nd oxygenation is still not yet \nat goal, increase the I:E ratio incrementally.  \nd. Tidal volume goal remains the same as with conventional ventilation; adjust cycle time (60/RR) \nto optimize minute ventilation.  \ne. Higher I:E ratios are not physiologic, so PC -IRV w ill likely require increased depth of sedation for \npatient comfort and synchrony.  \n3) Paralysis for Patient -Ventilator Synchronization  \na. Adequate depth of sedation is essential prior to starting a paralyzing medication; recommend RASS greater than -2.  \nb. SCCM and DoD COVID-19 Practice Management Guide\n recommend intermittent paralytics over \ncontinuous infusions, if possible.  Continuous infusion can result in pr olonged paralysis if not \nclosely monitored, especially if muscle twitch monitor is not available.  \nc. Paralysis with Vecuronium:  \n Bolus: 5mg to 10mg every 60-90 minutes as needed.  \n Infusion: 0.8 to 1.2mcg/kg/min (approx. 80mcg/min for 80kg).  \n Without pump: 40mg v ecuronium in 250mL bag (50mL wasted) of normal saline yields \n40mg/250mL = 160mcg/mL.  For 80mcg/min = 0.5mL/min ~ 1gt every 12 seconds in 10gt \ntubing.  \nd. Monitoring Goal:  \n Absence of muscle movement and no evidence of spontaneous breathing on the ventilator.  \nIf possible, titrate to 2/4 TOF (testing device likely only available for surgical teams).  \n Increased HR and BP may suggest inadequate sedation and should be empirically treated by \nincreasing sedation.  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  22  Once the patient is stabilized, consider holding the pa ralytic at least once every 24 hours to \nprovide for assessment of sedation depth.  \n DO NOT hold sedation until paralytic wears off unless absolutely necessary (e.g. , sudden \nhypotension). \n4) Prone Positioning  \na. “Awake Self -Proning” with high flow nasal cannula devices has been successfully used in \npatients with moderate to severe COVID -19 lung disease.  If patients are unable to tolerate \nprone positioning (i.e. strong desire to remain in a tripod position), DO NOT force them into the \nprone position.  \nb. Reference DoD COVID-19 Practice Management Guide  for full details on prone positioning \nprecautions and procedures. \nc. Placement of either a central line or additional peripheral access is strongly encouraged PRIOR \nto prone positioning.  \nd. Have push -dose vasopressor medication available during the process of prone positioning and \nun-positioning, as hypotension frequently occurs.  \ne. Proning cycle is generally 16 hours of prone positioning each 24 hours.  Match the proning \ncycle to the daily care plan as much as possible.  \nf. Prone positioning may not be feasible or safe during evacuation . \nAnticipate Complications  \n1) Pneumothorax can occur with higher PIP.  Sudden increases in PIP and/o r hemodynamic instability \nmay indicate  pneumothorax. \n2) Pneumomediastinum with subcutaneous emphysema can also develop with the use of high PEEP \n(typically from dissection of air into the adventitia o f small bronchi/bronchioles).  The development \nof crepitus across the chest, neck, and/or upper extremities suggests th e presence of this condition.  \nTension physiology from pneumomediastinum is EXCEEDINGLY rare and usually no intervention is \nneeded.  \n3) Acute kidney injury  leading to renal failure is a genuine threat  to seriously ill COVID -19 patients.  \nPatients unable to make urine can develop fatal arrhythmias from electrolyte abnormalities and acidotic blood.  They need to be evacuated to a location capable of renal replacement therapy  as \nsoon as possible.  \na. Oliguria  is defined as less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour of urine output (UOP).  \nb. Oliguric patients should receive a bolus of 500 cc crystalloid.  This may be repeated once if UOP \ndoes not improve.  If the patient remains oliguric after a 1L bolus , consider the onset of acut e \ntubular necrosis (ATN), especially if UOP remains low for more than 6 hours.   \nc. As formal creatinine testing for acute kidney injury (AKI) is not likely to be available, consider urine dipstick testing with attention to specific gravity, proteinuria, and hematuria:   \n An abnormally low (dilute) specific gravity in the setting of oliguria suggests tubular damage \nand the inability to concentrate urine.  \n Significant proteinuria can be seen in ATN; however, this is not specific and can be seen in a variety of ac ute medical conditions . \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  23  Hematuria may suggest the presence of myoglobinuria –  consider rhabdomyolysis as a \ncause of acute kidney injury . \nd. If UOP suddenly declines or stops, flushing the Foley and/or performing a bladder ultrasound \nscan can help determine if  the problem is mechanical (Foley blockage) or organic (true kidney \ninjury).  \ne. Once ATN sets in, do not aggressively fluid resuscitate or diurese  simply to meet UOP goals.  \nUse alternative markers of fluid responsiveness (like blood pressure response to pass ive straight \nleg raise) to help determine the need for further fluids and vasopressor medications.  \nf. Monitor closely for the development of electrolyte disturbances, specifically metabolic acidosis \nand hyperkalemia.  Use medical  management of hyperkalemia as appropriate.  The JTS CPG on \nHyperkalemia and Dialysis in the Deployed Setting  describes field -expedient techniques for \nperitoneal dialysis; however, this should be done in concert with tel econsultation.  \nHemodynamics & Monitoring  \n1) An IV pump is  recommend ed over dial-a -flow and drip -chamber titration (if available).  \n2) When outdoors, plac e the monitor, ventilator, and IV pumps upwind and as far away as possible \nfrom the patient to minimize contamination  of caregivers . \n3) Establish arterial line  monitoring early  when possible for patients with severe COVID -19 disease as \nthey often become hemodynamically unstable.  \n4) If possible, establish central access early in anticipation of the need for continuous va sopressors.  \nMultiple peripheral IVs may also be needed for infusions of sedatives, analgesia, antibiotics, etc.  \n5) A conventional central venous catheter can be placed through an introducer catheter (i.e. Cordis) to expand the number of available infusion po rts.  This should be done during the initial insertion \nunder sterile technique, if possible.  \n6) Some severely ill COVID -19 patients may develop  dilated cardio -myopathy with florid cardiogenic \nshock.  This may be secondary to systemic inflammation, stress, or a direct viral myocarditis.  \nPatients may also develop arrhythmias.  Manage arrhythmias following Red Cross advanced life support  guidelines.  \n7) An unexpected change in the vital sign trends or hypotension out of proportion to sedation and PEEP should merit e valuation for additional causes of shock.  Limited transthoracic \nechocardiography may be useful in discriminating between hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and \ndistributive shock (in personnel trained to perform the assessment).  \n8) Utilize dynamic parameters (i.e. sk in temperature, capillary refilling time, pulse pressure variation, \nblood pressure response to passive straight leg raise, and/or serum lactate measurement) over \nstatic parameters to help guide the need for further fluid resuscitation  (\nSurviving Sepsis Campaign \nCOVID -19 Guidelines ). \n9) Norepinephrine is the  first line vasopressor for most causes of shock.  Fixed rate vasopressin \ninfusion (0.04 units/min) is useful as an early adju nct in non -cardiogenic shock; start vasopressin \nwhen norepinephrine reaches doses above 12mcg/min.  Epinephrine is sometimes the only option available in remote locations.   \n10) Vasopressors should be titrated to a MAP goal of 60 - 65 mm Hg. (\nSurviving Sepsis Campaign COVID -\n19 Guidelines .) \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  24 Continued C are & Prophylaxis  \n1) Nasogastric or orogastric tube (NG/OGT) should be placed early for gastrointestinal decompression.  \nIf medical evacu ation is significantly delayed (greater than 24 -48 hours), consider starting enteral \nnutrition.  \n2) Enteral nutrition is contraindicated in hemodynamically unstable patients (i.e. those on high or \nincreasing doses of vasopressors).  Low volume tube feeding on patients with stable low doses of \nvasopressors is generally safe.  \n3) At a minimum, confirm p osition of gastric  tube  placement with auscultation over both lung fields \nand the abdomen along with aspiration of gastric contents.  Urinalysis test strips for pH may  provide \nan addition method for NG/OGT placement confirmation in patients not on acid suppressive \ntherapy.  \n4) Goal 25 -30 kcal/kg/day + 1 -1.2 gm/kg protein; however, this might be difficult, especially in the \nabsence of formal concentrated tube feeds.  \n5) Meal sup plement drinks are not sufficient.  For example, one  Muscle Milk Light bottle contains only \n150 kcal and 28  gm protein in 500  mL, which is extremely dilute compared to most tube feeding \nformulations.  This potentially increase extra -vascular lung water (es pecially in the setting of critical \nillness) with minimal benefit to nutritional status.  \n6) A more concentrated alternative is to use commercially available protein powder (with similar \ncaloric/protein content per scoop) at 1/4 the recommended concentration a nd mix in a blender until \nno clumps are visible.  Administer in small volume boluses (e.g. , 60mL via Toomey syringe) as \ntolerated every 2 to 4 hours to a goal of 1  gm/kg/day protein content.  \n7) Further recommendations for enteral nutrition can be found in JTS CPG for Nutritional Support \nUsing Enteral and Parenteral Methods . \n8) If possible, blood sugar checks should be obtained at least every 6 hours, particularly for those with known diabetes melli tus. \n9) Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis should be given as long as there are no \ncontraindications.  Patients with COVID have demonstrated and increase risk of the formation of \nthrombus formation, therefore it is recommended to administer Lovenox 30 mg SQ twice daily  \n(avoid if evidence of renal failure) or 7,5 00 units  heparin SQ every 8 hours.  \n10) If pharmacologic prophylaxis is not available, manual ankle plantar/dorsi -flexion range of motion \nexercises and lower extremity massage every two hours.  Consider applying compression stockings if \navailable.  DO NOT use ACE wraps. \n11) Stress -Ulcer Prophylaxis should be given to all intubated patients as long as there are no \ncontraindications.  Famotidine 20  mg IV every 12 hours or 20 mg via NG/OGT twice daily, o r \nconsi der and a proton pu mp inhibitor, if available (i.e.  pantoprazole 40  mg IV daily or omeprazole \nvia NG/OGT daily).  \n12) Ventilator Associated Pneumonia prevention bundle applied to the limitations of an austere environment includes:  \n Head-of -bed elevation to 30 de grees  \n Suction the oropharynx as needed  \n Brush teeth every 12 hours , ideally with commercially prepared Chlorhexidine oral care if \navailable.  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  25 13) The JTS CPG for Nursing Interventions in Prolonged  Field Care  provides in -depth discussion of the \nnursing tasks that may be required if medical evacuation is significantly delayed.  \nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation  \nCardiopulmonary arrest is a difficult topic.  Generally speaking , in cases of cardiac arrest,  \nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) in an austere environment may  not be a wise  use of resources \nunless the etiology for the arrest is rapidly reversible.  Additionally, significant aerosol generation will \ninvariably occur during CPR of a COVID -19 patient .  It is reasonable during a pandemic to establish \nmedical rules of engagement that discourage providers from performing CPR on infected patients.  If CPR is performed, efforts should focus on reducing provider exposure to COVID -19 and prioritizing \nstrateg ies with lower aerosol for mation risk.  (See DoD Covid -19 PMG\n.) \nPatient Evacuation Considerations for Austere Medicine  \nEach AOR should develop its own plan for categorizing COVID -19 patients (for the purposes of isolation \nand evacuation) based on guidance found in DoD policy.  \nMedical Evacuation  \nMedical Evacuation using MedCon levels described in Appendix A  is one example.  \n1) Patient m ovement should be anticipated for COVID -19 PUIs categorized as MedCon 2 or higher.  \nThere is no reason to delay notification request for evacuation.  \n2) Ground and Air Medical Transport will depend on local CASEVAC/MEDEVAC notification plan and \nCASEVAC /MEDEVAC platforms available for transport.   \n3) When clinically and operationally feasible and within the provider’s scope of practice, obtain central venous access in anticipation of need for multiple infusions, including vasopressors, during \ntransport.  Obtain at least two peripheral IV’s or one peripheral plus one central line access prior to \ntransport, if possible.  \n4) Early placement of arterial line for invasive pressure monitoring is recommended, if available.  \n5) If there is evidence or suspicion for acute co ronary syndrome or myocarditis, coordinate the medical \nmanagement via teleconsultation prior to transport, if possible.  \n6) Patients requiring >3 Lpm oxygen support to maintain oxygen saturations >93% may not tolerate the hypoxic environment of aeromedical ev acuation even with cabin altitude restrictions:  \na. Given concerns surrounding risk associated with procedures done emergently during transport, consider the need  endotracheal intubation  prior to transport .  \nb. The most experienced provider should perform the pro cedure to secure the airway.  Use a video \nlaryngoscope (if available) and rapid sequence induction. \nc. Minimize people in the room during the procedure.  Verify all staff have the best available PPE . \n(See Appendix B\n.) \nd. Consider con sulting the Advanced Critical Care Evacuation Team (ACCET) DSN 312 -429-BURN \n(2876) before transporting patients on moderate to high ventilator settings (PEEP > 14 and FiO 2 \n> 70%).  Refer to JTS CPG for Acute Respiratory Failure . \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  26 e. If prone ventilation is to be utilized in-flight, it should be initiated on the ground with adequate \ntime to document patient stability before transport.  \n7) If intubated, an NG/OGT should be placed pre -flight and attache d to intermittent suction.  \n8) Pre-drawn and pre- mixed medications with primed tubing are examples of time saving measures to \nbe optimized on the patient prior to transport.  \n9) Prepare patient records for handoff including medical notes, ECGs, laboratory results , and imaging \nresults (if available).  \n10) Prepare patient belongings and ID/passport to accompany the patient.  \n11) Place PPE for flight on patient including eye protection and ear protection, and DO NOT forget face covering if not intubated.  \nTransition of Care for  Evacuation  \n1) Early patient reporting allows  the evacuation team to prepare.  \na. The sending facility medical team should provide contact information (if possible) . \nb. The evacuation team should contact the sending facility prior to mission (if possible) . \n2) Handoff t o the transport team should include:  \na. Up-to-date COVID -19 testing status (PUI vs confirmed) . \nb. Current vital signs, exam findings, and recent trends or changes . \nc. Current medication regimen if initiated (including antibiotics and anticoagulants) . \nd. Critical care medication regimen (sedation, analgesia, paralysis, and vasopressors) . \ne. Current PPE status, oxygen requirements and ventilator settings . \nf. Any potential COVID -19 related complications identified during management (e.g.,  heavy \nrespiratory secretions) . \n3) Upon eva cuation team arrival to receive the patient, handoff report should be repeated with key \nelements above, including any recent patient changes.  \n4) Transition to the evacuation team monitoring and support equipment will present risk of exposure to healthcare te am.  In an attempt to mitigate this risk, consider the following:  \na. Personnel should be limited to those directly involved in the care of the patient . \nb. Best available PPE should be worn by everyone involved in the care transition.  \nc. ETT clamping technique shoul d be instituted to limit aerosol creation during all ventilator circuit \nbreaks including transfer to evacuation team ventilator . \nd. Sufficient time should be allotted to confirm adequate oxygenation and ventilation prior to departure of the evacuation team.  \nManagement of COVID -19 in Austere Operational Environments , v3.0 (ID: 85) 23 Apr  2021  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  27 Establishing a Plan for Telemedicine Consultation  \n1) Regional Medical Operations Cell should prospectively publish local and regional PACE (Primary-\nAlternate -Contingency -Emergency) plans for both operational and clinical consultation.  Forward-\nstationed medica l teams should test these options PRIOR to needing urgent consultation.  \n2) Make use of telehealth resources such as the ADVISOR line ( 866-972-9966, or 833-238-7756), that \nincludes the Virtual Critical Care Consultation (VC3) service.  The ADVISOR program is s pecifically \ndesigned for operational virtual health support.  Additionally, many VC3 consultants have deployed \nto remote locations and can help work through the unique problems faced in austere settings.  \nAdditional information on ADVISOR can be obtained b y emailing dod.advisor_office@mail.mil . \n3) Alternatively, contact the following MEDCENs and ask for the on -call critical care staff:  \nLandstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany.
