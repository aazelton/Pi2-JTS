These CPGs provide recommendations to deployed clinicians abo ut the\ncare of trauma patients with specific conditions and are not a substitute for clinical judgment. The CPGs were developed thro ugh\nevidence -based research, systematic review of the literature, PI indicators and input from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).\nBACKGROUND\nCPGs are “statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of\nevidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options.”1 To date, over 80 CPGs have been instituted to\ninform the standard of care for the US military in the deployed setting and are reflective of the current “state of the art” at the time\nof release.\nCPGs are developed based on the best available evidence and SME consensus, providing clinicians with recommendations to improve the quality of care, standardization of care and serve as an educational resource while deployed. A systematic and\noperationally  responsive approach to development, verification and implementation of CPGs is taken to ensure rapid field\ndissemination and provide quality indicators to measure effectiveness. Department of Defense (DoD) trauma cases worldwide are\nreviewed for CPG compl iance by JTS in accordance with PI metrics specified at the end of each CPG.\nJTS guidelines may be updated frequently based on operational need and clinical observations and have all been written by SME\nvolunteers. CPGs undergo revisions when the clinical or operational need arises. The JTS CPGs currently do not meet the Natio nal\nAcademies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine standards for CPG development\n1 to facilitate expediency, responsiveness to the\nmilitary operational environment and rapid performance improvement. In some cases, there may be little published literature\n(milita ry or civilian) to guide battlefield or operational medicine, requiring heavy reliance on SME opinion or unpublished analysis  of\nmilitary data. JTS CPGs are timely and reflect evolving threats, technologies, and current realities on the battlefield. The JTS\nrecommends every deploying clinician in their respective Combatant Command (CCMD ) who will be providing care for casualties\nbecomes familiar with the CPGs posted on the JTS website.\nStrong evidence demonstrates CPG compliance is associated with a reduction in mortality.2-4  The Donabedian Model for quality\nimprovement in health care states that, besides patient characteristics, institutional structures and clinical practices dete rmine\npatient outcome.5  Evidence -based CPGs are developed to avoid unnecessary variation and promote consistency in healthcare\npractice throughout the continuum of care to achieve optimal outcomes. JTS CPGs complement the deployed PI process. Since the\nearly d ays of the U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) trauma system, the guidelines have been developed and implemented by\nclinical SMEs in response to needs identified in the CCMD  Area of Operations (AOR). More recently, as the trauma system has\nmatured, the process for identifying, developing, vetting, approving, and implementing CPGs has also matured.\nTo the greatest extent possible, JTS CPGs are evidence -based. The evidence is derived from the published literature, to include\nanalysis of combat casualty data. When evidence is lacking or unclear, yet a CPG is needed, guidelines are developed based on the\nbest available evidence and SME consensus. In order to ensure CPGs include the latest techniques and innovations, monitoring of all\nCPGs is essential. To ensure monitoring, each individual CPG will include a system -level PI monitoring plan. Monitoring sp ecifics (e.g.,\ntiming, frequency, performance measures) are written in the PI monitoring plan for each CPG. This system -wide monitoring will be\nconducted by the JTS PI Branch. The PI plan will state the intent and minimum performance measures that will be utilized for\nmonitoring. Trauma directors or their equivalents at the deployed military treatment facility level are expected to implement local PI\nprocesses to ensure appropriate adherence to the CPGs; the PI monitoring plan will help guide these efforts. Routine updates to\nCPGs occur every five years or as the operational need arises or as new evidence surfaces. SMEs include, but are not limited to,\nmilitary and DoD civilian experts, deployed clinicians, Service specialty consultants, trauma medical direc tors, trauma program\nmanagers, JTS Branch Chiefs, and trauma PI nurse analysts.\nAlthough the JTS CPGs were originally developed for USCENTCOM, they are no longer specific to any particular CCMD or\ncontingency. JTS CPGs are patient -centric guidelines with the intent of keeping the medicine joint and agnostic of Service or location.\nBecause CCMDs greatly differ in climate, terrain, and resources, the JTS CPGs are not representative of a specific CCMD or\ncontingency. Services, unit organizations, and trauma directors may tailor to unit missions, deployed settings, and unique situations.\nJTS CPG Development Process   CPG ID: 54\n3 CPG   DEVELOPMENT   –  NEW  CPG\nTOPIC   IDENTIFICATION\nAny DoD Service Member can propose a topic for CPG development or revision to the JTS CPG Manager.  At a minimum, a new CPG\ntopic must include:\n A description of the proposed guideline and perceived gap in care.\n Identification of end -users of the guideline.\n Identification of changes in performance to be driven by the guideline.\n The JTS CPG manager  will take CPG proposal and :\n Cross reference proposals with existing CPGs.\n Identify way ahead course of actions (COAs)\n Present COAs to JTS clinical leadership (DCoT Chief, DCoT Committee Chairs, PI Chief, and JTS Chief) for decision.\nTOPIC   SELECTION\nThe JTS CPG Branch/DCoT /JTS Chief w ill determine the need for the proposed CPG topic based on:\n Relevance to the deployed combat casualty environment\n Potential for reduction of clinically significant variations\n Incidence, prevalence, or trend identified by DoD Trauma Registry data\n Evolution of best practices\n Findings and implementation of lessons learned\n Requests from theater/CCMD/Service\n Target audience of CPG (prehospital, en route care, role 2/3)\nSubmit CPG topic recommendations to: dha.jbsa.healthcare -ops.list.jts- cpg@health.mil\nKEY  CPG  DEVELOPMENT   STEPS\nOnce the proposed CPG topic is approved, DCoT Committee Chair with CPG Manager will initiate the CPG process:\n1.

High quality medical imaging can be accomplished successfully in a deployed or wartime\nsetting.  Due to advances in aggressive resuscitation techniques and the speed of the latest generation Computed Tomography (CT) scanners (64 -detector and beyond), rapid  trauma scans utilizing CT and Ultrasound\n(US) imaging can routinely be performed prior to taking the patient to the operating room potentially providing the trauma team with lifesaving information. This C linical P ractice Guideline (CPG) provides an overvi ew of the\nimaging modalities available in austere settings, the equipment required, and the role that each plays in triaging\nand diagnosis of the acutely injured poly -trauma patients.\nGiven the catastrophic injuries sustained by high -energy mechanisms, inc luding high velocity ballistic trauma\nand blast injuries often seen during the current conflict, rapid diagnosis and treatment is required to optimally\ntreat these critically injured patients. Advances in aggressive resuscitation techniques and the speed of the\nlatest generation Computed Tomography (CT) scanners (64 -detector and beyond), rapid trauma scans utilizing\nCT and Ultrasound (US) imaging routinely allows for imaging to be performed prior to taking the patient to the operating room potentially provi ding the trauma team with lifesaving information .\nImaging has become a critical component of the care of any patient in the age of modern medicine.  The goal of\nthis CPG is to provide guidelines and recommendations for the optimum integration of high quali ty diagnostic\nimaging into the treatment and management of casualties with multiple mechanisms of traumatic injuries and\nhow to facilitate the transfer of this information with the patient across the continuum of care.\nIMAGING  EVALUATION\nRADIOGRAPHS\nThe initial radiographic evaluation of a trauma patient begins with supine Anterior -Posterior (AP) chest and\npelvis radiographs taken in the trauma bay usually with a portable x-ray machine. The initial focus being major\ncardiopulmonary injury and fracture dis locations of the pelvis, the latter can be an indicator of life -threatening\ninternal hemorrhage and/or need for pelvic stabilization.\nFragments\nRadiographs can easily demonstrate metallic fragments common in military specific trauma that can be helpful\nin determining potential sites of injury and injury tracts.\nCervical  S pine\nCervical spine radiographic evaluation has been largely replaced by CT and should only be performed w hen a CT\nis unavailable.  Refer to the JTS CPG, Cervi cal and Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Evaluation, Transport, and Surgery\nin the Deployed Setting , for further guidance.1,2\nRadiology: Imaging Trauma Patients in a Deployed Setting CPG ID: 01\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  3 Extremity  I njuries\nIf extremity injury is suspected, radiographs can be obtained; however, these can be time-consuming and should\nnot delay more diagnostic imaging with CT, if available (Role 3 and above) . Additionally with CT, extremity\nosseous and soft tissue injuries can be easily identified with the added benefit of a lower extremity angiogram as\nwell. See Trauma CT Scan  section below .3\nRetrograde  Urethrogram\nWhen there is a clinical suspicion of possible urethral injury, which can occur with significant pelvic fractures or\npenetrating perineal injury, a retrograde urethrogram may be helpful to further  characterize the injury. One\nfield expedient method uses the portable x-ray machine with a single oblique AP scout image of the pelvis. 10cc\nof contrast is injected into the tip of the urethra through a Foley catheter. While injecting additional contrast\nthrough the catheter an image of the pelvis/urethra is obtained in the same slight AP oblique position. This\nimage is typically obtained at the end of an injection of 17 -20 cc of IV contrast but prior to the completion of the\ninjection to insure full luminal distention with contrast.\nEquipment\nA variety of portable x -ray units are utilized in theater at Role 2 and Role 3 facilities. Many of the portable units,\nespecially at the Role 2, have limited ability to penetrate (limited range of kVp and mAs) soft ti ssues. Obtaining\nlateral views generally requires penetrating a greater thickness of soft tissue, particularly in large patients, and often produces very limited quality images. AP projection images should be adequate on most portable units,\nbut will rely upon the x-ray technician to optimize technique to maximize image quality.\nRadiation  Safety\nMembers of the trauma team should have lead aprons and thyroid shields available near the trauma bay.  In\nideal situations, trauma team members will don the lead s hielding beneath other personal protective equipment\nprior to patient arrival. Distance is also protective from radiation exposure. If feasible based on the patient’s\ncondition, any personnel without lead shielding should move a short distance (recommended  minimal distance\n6 feet) away from the x -ray unit. Cross table lateral images produce a much higher level of radiation exposure to\npersonnel in the trauma bay and nearby areas and should only be obtained when absolutely necessary.\nRadiation certainly rema ins a concern during the performance of all imaging particularly with CT. The radiologist\nshould carefully monitor mAs and kVp settings such that dose is minimized while achieving sufficient diagnostic\nimage quality.\nFOCUSED  ABDOMINAL   SONOGRAPHIC  ASSESSMENT   FOR  TRAUMA   (FAST)\nEXAMINATION\nWhile the FAST scan has been validated only in hemodynamically unstable blunt trauma patients, it has become\na standard tool in the trauma bay and Emergency Department (ED) in most trauma patients.4 It is now\nconsidered an adjunct to the primary survey in Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines, ninth edition.5\nIt has also come into use for hemodynamically stable patients and penetrating trauma in the deployed setting where CT scans are not readily available. If positive, these scans provide quick information that can aid trauma\nsurgeons in triaging patients, either to the Operating Room (OR) or to further imaging. FAST in combat trauma\nRadiology: Imaging Trauma Patients in a Deployed Setting CPG ID: 01\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  4 has a sensitivity of only 56% and specificity of 98%.6  Routine use of the FAS T in trauma patients allows for a\nconsistent evaluation strategy while maintaining the skills of providers. A negative FAST cannot be relied upon to\nrule out injury, especially in penetrating trauma.\nDiagnostic  Peritoneal   Lavage  (DPL)\nIn the absence of a CT scanner, DPL should be considered in determining need for laparotomy in trauma patients. It has largely been supplanted by the FAST exam (and is considered an optional skill in the current\nedition of ATLS). DPL remains the most sensitive test for hollow viscus injury and mesenteric injury, and retains its usefulness in the unstable patient with a negative or equivocal FAST exam. DPL is 100% accurate for intrabdominal injury in these patients.\n7  One must consider the additional time that this diagnostic  test may\nrequire, and should not delay immediate surgical intervention in patients that have mechanisms concerning for\nintra -abdominal trauma and remain unstable despite resuscitative measures.8\nRole  of  the  Radiologist\nAt the Role 3, properly trained providers including radiologists, surgeons and emergency physicians, can perform\nand interpret FAST scans in the ED on a hand held portable US device. The utility of radiologists performing the\nexams would be to free up emergency providers and surgeons to either perform other assessments or interventions, or care for additional patients in the trauma bays. While in the trauma bay, the radiologist would also be available to provide preliminary interpretations of the portable chest x -ray/pelvis exams on the d igital\nportable machines. However, once CT scans begin to be obtained on the trauma patients, the emergency\nphysicians and surgeons would primarily perform the FAST scans and interpret plain radiographs at the bedside.\nEquipment\nThe examination is performed with a portable hand -held machine most commonly using a standard 3 -7 MHz\ncurved array US probe.  A phased array probe is also acceptable, and occasionally is preferred if cardiac or pulmonary imaging is necessary. Real -time imaging is performed without the necessity of saving static images.\nStandard  Examination\nThe standard FAST examination is focused on evaluating for the presence of free intraperitoneal fluid in:\n1. The right upper quadrant between the liver and kidney,\n2. The left upper quadrant between the spleen and kidney, and ;\n3. The pelvis at the level of the bladder.\n4. An evaluation for cardiac activity and hemopericardium/tamponade should also be performed by placing the probe in the subxiphoid location and aiming towards the patients left shoulder.\n4\nAdditional  Examinations\nThe cardiac portion of the exam  can rapidly identify cardiac injury, evaluate cardiac function and give\ninformation about the success of resuscitation.9  In the case of massive exsanguination; the examination should\nbe rechecked fo r free fluid after blood is given. A clot identified within a ventricle indicates prolonged asystole\nand may aid in the decision to terminate efforts. Pneumothorax or hemothorax may also be identified by placing\nthe probe along the chest wall and looking f or the presence of lung sliding. Loss of sliding implies the possible\npresence of a pneumothorax.10\nRadiology: Imaging Trauma Patients in a Deployed Setting CPG ID: 01\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 TRAUMA   CT  SCAN\nIf at all possible given the patient’s clinical stability, a trauma CT can be performed before going to OR. Often\nindications for surgical intervention are already present; however the CT scan can provide additional information to the surgeon, identifying unsuspected and potentially clinically significant injuries. Given the\nrelatively small footprint of most Role 3 facilities the patient can be taken to the OR immediately following the\nacquisition of the CT scan, with the radiologist providing the pertinent findings to surgeons while in the OR. For\nclinically unstable patients, this trauma CT can be obtained after continued resuscitation and surgical\nintervention in the OR.\n11\nCT  Protocol   (Adult)\n. Initial acquisition includes non-contrast CT through head and face (to include the entire mandible), at 1 mm\naxial slice thickness which allows for isotropic sagittal and coronal reformatted images. This scan is followed by a contrast enha nced CT from the level of the c ircle of Willis through the bottom of the pelvis. Alternatively in the\nsetting of significant lower extremity trauma such as dismounted complex blast injury, the scan can be\nperformed through the lower extremities (default through the feet) allowing evaluation of skeletal and vascular\ninjury of the lower extremities. A discussion with the trauma team should be performed prior to the scan to establish the inferior extent of the sc an coverage. Of course, additional information including long bone\nfractures and metallic fragments can be seen on the scout image, which may alter the scan coverage to include those areas. Some difficulties may arise if the patient is tall and the CT gantry movement does not allow coverage through the lower extremities, however this can be ameliorated by scanning from the head to as low as possible, then either physically sliding the patient up on the gantry or rotating them 180 degrees on the\ngantry table and scanning through the remainder of the legs.\n11-13   See Appendix A  for more information.\nCT  Review\n3D workstations are a required resource in any civilian trauma center and are a required resource for any Role 3\nwhere majo r casualties are expected. These workstations allow the radiologist a rapid overview of injuries and\nability to zoom into abnormalities. Additionally these powerful workstations allow for rapid creation of detailed 3D shaded surface and multiplanar reconstructions that facilitate a broad overview of numerous soft tissue and osseous injuries at different locations and accentuate the location of fragments. Utilizing these shaded bone or skin surface and Multiplanar Reconstruction (MPR) images can be very help ful for injury tract analysis. The\nworkstation also enables focused arterial vascular analysis, thus supporting early identification of more subtle\nvascular injuries that can have a significant clinical impact on patient morbidity and mortality.\n13  In mass  casualty\nsituations, a modified workflow may be necessary. The performance of preliminary readings or “wet reads” may be required, especially when there is a sole radiologist present.\nIV  Access   for  CT\n18g antecubital IV is typically desired – if pla ced on a medical evacuation platform prior to arrival, the cannula\nmust be thoroughly rechecked/flushed to ensure function and avoid contrast extravasation. More distal upper extremity IVs should typically not be used due to the risk of extravasation and c ompartment syndrome. A central\nline can be used for contrast power  injection . A large lumen resuscitation catheter such as those utilized for the\nrapid infusion device (normally rated up to 9cc/sec) can usually  handle contrast injection.\n14  Ensure that the\ncorrect size catheter lumen is utilized for the power injection as the catheter will often have various sized\nlumens. The largest lumen of catheter would be the best to handle the power injection. Of course, should the\nrapid infusion device be used to infuse fluid/blood products at the same time, it should be turned off during the\ninjection to avoid dilution of the contrast with the instillate. Current intraosseous needles should not be used for contrast administration.  Though a few case reports of individual patients undergoing CT examination with contrast injection through IO needles have been published, larger studies in trauma patients are needed to\nestablish efficacy, adverse effects, and bolus timing modifications .\nRadiology: Imaging Trauma Patients in a Deployed Setting CPG ID: 01\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 CT  Contrast  Injection\nThe goal o f the injection is to provide concurrent solid organ enhancement, arterial enhancement, and\npulmonary arterial. Typical doses are approximately 150 cc of Isovue 300 or 340 contrasts utilizing a dual phase\ninjection – 80cc at 1.4 cc/sec, followed immediately by 70cc at 3.5 cc/sec for the pan scan. The scan is started 2 -\n3 seconds before the completion of the contrast injection to maximize pulmonary arterial filling. For pediatric\ninjection volume and rates by weight, see Appendix B .\nRectal   Contrast\nThis can be helpful when evaluating penetrating flank injuries or possible rectal involvement below the peritoneal reflection from pelvic injuries. One may utilize 1L of saline/water with the addition of 1 bottle (50ml)\nof IV contrast. A Foley catheter is used to cannulate the rectum and the balloon is instilled with saline. In the\nsetting of significant rectal or perineal trauma the surgeon may need to place the Foley catheter in the rectum.\n16\nDelayed  Images\nRoutinely performed for further evaluation of identified solid organ injury, identify active extravasation or\npseudoaneurysm formation, which can aid surgeons in grading the solid organ injury. Additionally, contrast excretion within the ureters and subsequently into the bladder can  also aid in diagnosis of injuries to these\nstructures.\nCT  Cystogram\n50 cc of IV contrast diluted into 500 cc of saline is infused through the indwelling urinary catheter. A minimum of\n300 cc and up to 500 cc of this dilute contrast material should be infused to provide adequate evaluation of the\nintegrity of the bladder wall.  The catheter is then clamped for the CT examination. This type of exam is performed following the routine trauma CT with 1mm thick images acquired through the pelvis with the bladder filled. If necessary, additional axial imaging of the bladder can be performed following the drainage of the contrast to detect more subtle extraperitoneal bladder injuries which may be obscured by the distended\nbladder.\n17\nCT  Language  Settings\nBecome familiar with the languages available/preloaded on the scanner for breathing instructions, which often include: English, French, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese. Using interpreters available in your facility, record the\nsame instructions in commonly encountered languages of coalition partners and host -nation patients (e.g.,\nArabic, Pashtun, Dari, Farsi, Georgian, Italian, Danish, Estonian, etc.). Ensure to select the correct language at the\ntime of scan setup for each patient.  Using these instructions will improve image quality for conscious patients.\nMILITARY  WORKING   DOGS   (MWD)\nGiven the nature of military operations in the current conflict , MWDs have sustained similar injuries to\ndismounted soldiers and will need CT trauma scans as well.18  These examinations will typically be performed in\nconsultation with veterinarians who will sedate the dog as necessary for the scan. However in an emergency situation, it may be necessary for the radiologist to perform the scan . Given this eventuality, prior coordination\nbetween the radiologist and veterinarian is essential. Utilize a scanning protocol based on the pediatric settings to include the doses of and rates of contrast administration. Refer to the JTS  CPG,\nClinical Management of\nMilitary Working Dog18 and Appendix B  for further details.\nRadiology: Imaging Trauma Patients in a Deployed Setting CPG ID: 01\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 IMAGE  TRANSFE R\nAll patients evacuated through casualty evacuation should have images sent electronically ahead of time as well\nas have a CD created to send with the patient as a backup. Although at times trauma patient’s true name may not be known during the initial evaluation, it should be stressed that usually it becomes known sometime soon thereafter. Ensuring the patient’s information is updated with the real name rather than a local hospital’s\ntrauma name will ensure those studies are available for review through t he health care evacuation system.\nMRI\nWhile MRI has been deployed to theater in the  past, its utility in the acute management of combat trauma ha s\nnot been established. Refer to the JTS CPG Use of MRI in M anagement of mTBI in the Deployed Setting .19\nPERFORMANCE   IMPROVEMENT   (PI)  MONITORING\nINTENT   (EXPECTED   OUTCOMES)\nAll trauma patients arriving at a Role 3 hospital will receive proper and expeditious radiologic screening of\ninjuries.\nPERFORMANCE/ADHERENCE  MEASURES\nIdentify  missed injuries with appropriate radiographic imaging and/or reading.\nDATA  SOURCE\nPatient Record\nDepartment of Defense Trauma Registry (DoDTR)\nTheater Image Repository\nSYSTEM  REPORTING   &  FREQUENCY\nThe above constitutes the minimum criteria for PI monitoring of this CPG. System reporting will be performed annually; additional PI monitoring and system reporting may be performed as needed.\nThe system review and data analysis will be performed by the JTS Chief and the JTS PI  Branch.\nRESPONSIBILITIES\nIt is the trauma team leader’s responsibility to ensure familiarity, appropriate compliance and PI monitoring at the local level with this CPG.\nREFERENCES\n1.Como JJ, Diaz JJ, Dunham CM, et al.

This applies to off -label\nuses with patients who are armed forces members.\nBACKGROUND\nUnapproved (i.e. “off-label”) uses of FDA-approved products are extremely common in American medicine and\nare usually not subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of  approved drugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These\ncircumstances include such uses as part of clinical trials, and in the military context, command required,\nunapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved uses may also be subject to special regulations.\nADDITIONAL   INFORMATION  REGARDING   OFF -LABEL   USES   IN  CPGS\nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further,\nit does not imply that the Mil itary Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers\nit to be the “standard of care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of\nthe responsible health care practitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship.\nADDITIONAL   PROCEDURES\nBalanced  Discussion\nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved\nby the FDA. Further, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data,\nincluding any such data that suggest caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA -issued\nwarnings.\nQuality  Assurance  Monitoring\nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance\nmonitoring of outcomes and known  potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate\nclinical records is underscored.\nInformation  to  Patients\nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an\nunusual off-label use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be\ngiven to including in an appendix an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before\nor after use of the product. Information to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not\napproved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a DoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this\npurpose; and c) the potential risks associated with such use."

High quality medical imaging can be accomplished successfully in a deployed or wartime \nsetting.  Due to advances in aggressive resuscitation techniques and the speed of the latest generation Computed Tomography (CT) scanners (64 -detector and beyond), rapid  trauma scans utilizing CT and Ultrasound \n(US) imaging can routinely be performed prior to taking the patient to the operating room potentially providing the trauma team with lifesaving information. This C linical P ractice Guideline (CPG) provides an overvi ew of the \nimaging modalities available in austere settings, the equipment required, and the role that each plays in triaging \nand diagnosis of the acutely injured poly -trauma patients.  \nGiven the catastrophic injuries sustained by high -energy mechanisms, inc luding high velocity ballistic trauma \nand blast injuries often seen during the current conflict, rapid diagnosis and treatment is required to optimally \ntreat these critically injured patients. Advances in aggressive resuscitation techniques and the speed of the \nlatest generation Computed Tomography (CT) scanners (64 -detector and beyond), rapid trauma scans utilizing \nCT and Ultrasound (US) imaging routinely allows for imaging to be performed prior to taking the patient to the operating room potentially provi ding the trauma team with lifesaving information . \nImaging has become a critical component of the care of any patient in the age of modern medicine.  The goal of \nthis CPG is to provide guidelines and recommendations for the optimum integration of high quali ty diagnostic \nimaging into the treatment and management of casualties with multiple mechanisms of traumatic injuries and \nhow to facilitate the transfer of this information with the patient across the continuum of care.  \nIMAGING  EVALUATION  \nRADIOGRAPHS  \nThe initial radiographic evaluation of a trauma patient begins with supine Anterior -Posterior (AP) chest and \npelvis radiographs taken in the trauma bay usually with a portable x-ray machine. The initial focus being major \ncardiopulmonary injury and fracture dis locations of the pelvis, the latter can be an indicator of life -threatening \ninternal hemorrhage and/or need for pelvic stabilization.  \nFragments  \nRadiographs can easily demonstrate metallic fragments common in military specific trauma that can be helpful \nin determining potential sites of injury and injury tracts. \nCervical  S pine \nCervical spine radiographic evaluation has been largely replaced by CT and should only be performed w hen a CT \nis unavailable.  Refer to the JTS CPG, Cervi cal and Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Evaluation, Transport, and Surgery \nin the Deployed Setting , for further guidance.1,2 \nRadiology: Imaging Trauma Patients in a Deployed Setting CPG ID: 01  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  3 Extremity  I njuries  \nIf extremity injury is suspected, radiographs can be obtained; however, these can be time-consuming and should \nnot delay more diagnostic imaging with CT, if available (Role 3 and above) . Additionally with CT, extremity \nosseous and soft tissue injuries can be easily identified with the added benefit of a lower extremity angiogram as \nwell. See Trauma CT Scan  section below .3 \nRetrograde  Urethrogram  \nWhen there is a clinical suspicion of possible urethral injury, which can occur with significant pelvic fractures or \npenetrating perineal injury, a retrograde urethrogram may be helpful to further  characterize the injury. One \nfield expedient method uses the portable x-ray machine with a single oblique AP scout image of the pelvis. 10cc \nof contrast is injected into the tip of the urethra through a Foley catheter. While injecting additional contrast \nthrough the catheter an image of the pelvis/urethra is obtained in the same slight AP oblique position. This \nimage is typically obtained at the end of an injection of 17 -20 cc of IV contrast but prior to the completion of the \ninjection to insure full luminal distention with contrast.  \nEquipment  \nA variety of portable x -ray units are utilized in theater at Role 2 and Role 3 facilities. Many of the portable units, \nespecially at the Role 2, have limited ability to penetrate (limited range of kVp and mAs) soft ti ssues. Obtaining \nlateral views generally requires penetrating a greater thickness of soft tissue, particularly in large patients, and often produces very limited quality images. AP projection images should be adequate on most portable units, \nbut will rely upon the x-ray technician to optimize technique to maximize image quality.  \nRadiation  Safety  \nMembers of the trauma team should have lead aprons and thyroid shields available near the trauma bay.  In \nideal situations, trauma team members will don the lead s hielding beneath other personal protective equipment \nprior to patient arrival. Distance is also protective from radiation exposure. If feasible based on the patient’s \ncondition, any personnel without lead shielding should move a short distance (recommended  minimal distance \n6 feet) away from the x -ray unit. Cross table lateral images produce a much higher level of radiation exposure to \npersonnel in the trauma bay and nearby areas and should only be obtained when absolutely necessary. \nRadiation certainly rema ins a concern during the performance of all imaging particularly with CT. The radiologist \nshould carefully monitor mAs and kVp settings such that dose is minimized while achieving sufficient diagnostic \nimage quality. \nFOCUSED  ABDOMINAL   SONOGRAPHIC  ASSESSMENT   FOR  TRAUMA   (FAST) \nEXAMINATION  \nWhile the FAST scan has been validated only in hemodynamically unstable blunt trauma patients, it has become \na standard tool in the trauma bay and Emergency Department (ED) in most trauma patients.4 It is now \nconsidered an adjunct to the primary survey in Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines, ninth edition.5 \nIt has also come into use for hemodynamically stable patients and penetrating trauma in the deployed setting where CT scans are not readily available. If positive, these scans provide quick information that can aid trauma \nsurgeons in triaging patients, either to the Operating Room (OR) or to further imaging. FAST in combat trauma \nRadiology: Imaging Trauma Patients in a Deployed Setting CPG ID: 01  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  4 has a sensitivity of only 56% and specificity of 98%.6  Routine use of the FAS T in trauma patients allows for a \nconsistent evaluation strategy while maintaining the skills of providers. A negative FAST cannot be relied upon to \nrule out injury, especially in penetrating trauma.  \nDiagnostic  Peritoneal   Lavage  (DPL)  \nIn the absence of a CT scanner, DPL should be considered in determining need for laparotomy in trauma patients. It has largely been supplanted by the FAST exam (and is considered an optional skill in the current \nedition of ATLS). DPL remains the most sensitive test for hollow viscus injury and mesenteric injury, and retains its usefulness in the unstable patient with a negative or equivocal FAST exam. DPL is 100% accurate for intrabdominal injury in these patients.\n7  One must consider the additional time that this diagnostic  test may \nrequire, and should not delay immediate surgical intervention in patients that have mechanisms concerning for \nintra -abdominal trauma and remain unstable despite resuscitative measures.8 \nRole  of  the  Radiologist  \nAt the Role 3, properly trained providers including radiologists, surgeons and emergency physicians, can perform \nand interpret FAST scans in the ED on a hand held portable US device. The utility of radiologists performing the \nexams would be to free up emergency providers and surgeons to either perform other assessments or interventions, or care for additional patients in the trauma bays. While in the trauma bay, the radiologist would also be available to provide preliminary interpretations of the portable chest x -ray/pelvis exams on the d igital \nportable machines. However, once CT scans begin to be obtained on the trauma patients, the emergency \nphysicians and surgeons would primarily perform the FAST scans and interpret plain radiographs at the bedside.  \nEquipment  \nThe examination is performed with a portable hand -held machine most commonly using a standard 3 -7 MHz \ncurved array US probe.  A phased array probe is also acceptable, and occasionally is preferred if cardiac or pulmonary imaging is necessary. Real -time imaging is performed without the necessity of saving static images.  \nStandard  Examination \nThe standard FAST examination is focused on evaluating for the presence of free intraperitoneal fluid in:  \n1. The right upper quadrant between the liver and kidney,  \n2. The left upper quadrant between the spleen and kidney, and ;  \n3. The pelvis at the level of the bladder.  \n4. An evaluation for cardiac activity and hemopericardium/tamponade should also be performed by placing the probe in the subxiphoid location and aiming towards the patients left shoulder.\n4 \nAdditional  Examinations  \nThe cardiac portion of the exam  can rapidly identify cardiac injury, evaluate cardiac function and give \ninformation about the success of resuscitation.9  In the case of massive exsanguination; the examination should \nbe rechecked fo r free fluid after blood is given. A clot identified within a ventricle indicates prolonged asystole \nand may aid in the decision to terminate efforts. Pneumothorax or hemothorax may also be identified by placing \nthe probe along the chest wall and looking f or the presence of lung sliding. Loss of sliding implies the possible \npresence of a pneumothorax.10 \nRadiology: Imaging Trauma Patients in a Deployed Setting CPG ID: 01  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 TRAUMA   CT  SCAN  \nIf at all possible given the patient’s clinical stability, a trauma CT can be performed before going to OR. Often \nindications for surgical intervention are already present; however the CT scan can provide additional information to the surgeon, identifying unsuspected and potentially clinically significant injuries. Given the \nrelatively small footprint of most Role 3 facilities the patient can be taken to the OR immediately following the \nacquisition of the CT scan, with the radiologist providing the pertinent findings to surgeons while in the OR. For \nclinically unstable patients, this trauma CT can be obtained after continued resuscitation and surgical \nintervention in the OR.\n11 \nCT  Protocol   (Adult)  \n. Initial acquisition includes non-contrast CT through head and face (to include the entire mandible), at 1 mm \naxial slice thickness which allows for isotropic sagittal and coronal reformatted images. This scan is followed by a contrast enha nced CT from the level of the c ircle of Willis through the bottom of the pelvis. Alternatively in the \nsetting of significant lower extremity trauma such as dismounted complex blast injury, the scan can be \nperformed through the lower extremities (default through the feet) allowing evaluation of skeletal and vascular \ninjury of the lower extremities. A discussion with the trauma team should be performed prior to the scan to establish the inferior extent of the sc an coverage. Of course, additional information including long bone \nfractures and metallic fragments can be seen on the scout image, which may alter the scan coverage to include those areas. Some difficulties may arise if the patient is tall and the CT gantry movement does not allow coverage through the lower extremities, however this can be ameliorated by scanning from the head to as low as possible, then either physically sliding the patient up on the gantry or rotating them 180 degrees on the \ngantry table and scanning through the remainder of the legs.\n11-13   See Appendix A  for more information.  \nCT  Review  \n3D workstations are a required resource in any civilian trauma center and are a required resource for any Role 3 \nwhere majo r casualties are expected. These workstations allow the radiologist a rapid overview of injuries and \nability to zoom into abnormalities. Additionally these powerful workstations allow for rapid creation of detailed 3D shaded surface and multiplanar reconstructions that facilitate a broad overview of numerous soft tissue and osseous injuries at different locations and accentuate the location of fragments. Utilizing these shaded bone or skin surface and Multiplanar Reconstruction (MPR) images can be very help ful for injury tract analysis. The \nworkstation also enables focused arterial vascular analysis, thus supporting early identification of more subtle \nvascular injuries that can have a significant clinical impact on patient morbidity and mortality.\n13  In mass  casualty \nsituations, a modified workflow may be necessary. The performance of preliminary readings or “wet reads” may be required, especially when there is a sole radiologist present.    \nIV  Access   for  CT \n18g antecubital IV is typically desired – if pla ced on a medical evacuation platform prior to arrival, the cannula \nmust be thoroughly rechecked/flushed to ensure function and avoid contrast extravasation. More distal upper extremity IVs should typically not be used due to the risk of extravasation and c ompartment syndrome. A central \nline can be used for contrast power  injection . A large lumen resuscitation catheter such as those utilized for the \nrapid infusion device (normally rated up to 9cc/sec) can usually  handle contrast injection.\n14  Ensure that the \ncorrect size catheter lumen is utilized for the power injection as the catheter will often have various sized \nlumens. The largest lumen of catheter would be the best to handle the power injection. Of course, should the \nrapid infusion device be used to infuse fluid/blood products at the same time, it should be turned off during the \ninjection to avoid dilution of the contrast with the instillate. Current intraosseous needles should not be used for contrast administration.  Though a few case reports of individual patients undergoing CT examination with contrast injection through IO needles have been published, larger studies in trauma patients are needed to \nestablish efficacy, adverse effects, and bolus timing modifications .  \nRadiology: Imaging Trauma Patients in a Deployed Setting CPG ID: 01  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 CT  Contrast  Injection  \nThe goal o f the injection is to provide concurrent solid organ enhancement, arterial enhancement, and \npulmonary arterial. Typical doses are approximately 150 cc of Isovue 300 or 340 contrasts utilizing a dual phase \ninjection – 80cc at 1.4 cc/sec, followed immediately by 70cc at 3.5 cc/sec for the pan scan. The scan is started 2 -\n3 seconds before the completion of the contrast injection to maximize pulmonary arterial filling. For pediatric \ninjection volume and rates by weight, see Appendix B . \nRectal   Contrast  \nThis can be helpful when evaluating penetrating flank injuries or possible rectal involvement below the peritoneal reflection from pelvic injuries. One may utilize 1L of saline/water with the addition of 1 bottle (50ml) \nof IV contrast. A Foley catheter is used to cannulate the rectum and the balloon is instilled with saline. In the \nsetting of significant rectal or perineal trauma the surgeon may need to place the Foley catheter in the rectum.\n16 \nDelayed  Images  \nRoutinely performed for further evaluation of identified solid organ injury, identify active extravasation or \npseudoaneurysm formation, which can aid surgeons in grading the solid organ injury. Additionally, contrast excretion within the ureters and subsequently into the bladder can  also aid in diagnosis of injuries to these \nstructures.  \nCT  Cystogram  \n50 cc of IV contrast diluted into 500 cc of saline is infused through the indwelling urinary catheter. A minimum of \n300 cc and up to 500 cc of this dilute contrast material should be infused to provide adequate evaluation of the \nintegrity of the bladder wall.  The catheter is then clamped for the CT examination. This type of exam is performed following the routine trauma CT with 1mm thick images acquired through the pelvis with the bladder filled. If necessary, additional axial imaging of the bladder can be performed following the drainage of the contrast to detect more subtle extraperitoneal bladder injuries which may be obscured by the distended \nbladder.\n17 \nCT  Language  Settings  \nBecome familiar with the languages available/preloaded on the scanner for breathing instructions, which often include: English, French, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese. Using interpreters available in your facility, record the \nsame instructions in commonly encountered languages of coalition partners and host -nation patients (e.g., \nArabic, Pashtun, Dari, Farsi, Georgian, Italian, Danish, Estonian, etc.). Ensure to select the correct language at the \ntime of scan setup for each patient.  Using these instructions will improve image quality for conscious patients.  \nMILITARY  WORKING   DOGS   (MWD)  \nGiven the nature of military operations in the current conflict , MWDs have sustained similar injuries to \ndismounted soldiers and will need CT trauma scans as well.18  These examinations will typically be performed in \nconsultation with veterinarians who will sedate the dog as necessary for the scan. However in an emergency situation, it may be necessary for the radiologist to perform the scan . Given this eventuality, prior coordination \nbetween the radiologist and veterinarian is essential. Utilize a scanning protocol based on the pediatric settings to include the doses of and rates of contrast administration. Refer to the JTS  CPG,  \nClinical Management of \nMilitary Working Dog18 and Appendix B  for further details.  \nRadiology: Imaging Trauma Patients in a Deployed Setting CPG ID: 01  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  7 IMAGE  TRANSFE R \nAll patients evacuated through casualty evacuation should have images sent electronically ahead of time as well \nas have a CD created to send with the patient as a backup. Although at times trauma patient’s true name may not be known during the initial evaluation, it should be stressed that usually it becomes known sometime soon thereafter. Ensuring the patient’s information is updated with the real name rather than a local hospital’s \ntrauma name will ensure those studies are available for review through t he health care evacuation system.  \nMRI  \nWhile MRI has been deployed to theater in the  past, its utility in the acute management of combat trauma ha s \nnot been established. Refer to the JTS CPG Use of MRI in M anagement of mTBI in the Deployed Setting .19 \nPERFORMANCE   IMPROVEMENT   (PI)  MONITORING  \nINTENT   (EXPECTED   OUTCOMES)  \nAll trauma patients arriving at a Role 3 hospital will receive proper and expeditious radiologic screening of \ninjuries. \nPERFORMANCE/ADHERENCE  MEASURES \nIdentify  missed injuries with appropriate radiographic imaging and/or reading.  \nDATA  SOURCE  \nPatient Record\nDepartment of Defense Trauma Registry (DoDTR)\nTheater Image Repository\nSYSTEM  REPORTING   &  FREQUENCY  \nThe above constitutes the minimum criteria for PI monitoring of this CPG.

This applies to off -label \nuses with patients who are armed forces members.   \nBACKGROUND  \nUnapproved (i.e. “off-label”) uses of FDA-approved products are extremely common in American medicine and \nare usually not subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of  approved drugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These \ncircumstances include such uses as part of clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, \nunapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved uses may also be subject to special regulations.   \nADDITIONAL   INFORMATION  REGARDING   OFF -LABEL   USES   IN  CPGS  \nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, \nit does not imply that the Mil itary Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers \nit to be the “standard of care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of \nthe responsible health care practitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship.  \nADDITIONAL   PROCEDURES \nBalanced  Discussion  \nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved \nby the FDA. Further, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, \nincluding any such data that suggest caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA -issued \nwarnings.  \nQuality  Assurance  Monitoring  \nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance \nmonitoring of outcomes and known  potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate \nclinical records is underscored. \nInformation  to  Patients  \nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an \nunusual off-label use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be \ngiven to including in an appendix an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before \nor after use of the product. Information to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not \napproved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a DoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this \npurpose; and c) the potential risks associated with such use.  \n \n",

Return To Duty (RTD) Screening :\n■Before returning to full duty, SM should pass the Physical AND Cognitive RTD Screenings to ensure mission readiness.\n■These tests should be performed after the service member has spent a minimum of 24 hours in Stage 5 without new or\nworsening symptoms.\n■The purpose of the RTD screening is to give the provider a way to objectively measure readiness for return to duty. This may be used in conjunction with patient’s subjective history of tolerated physical and cognitive activities.\n■Consider MOS/NEC/AFSC service specific return to duty requirements (e.g. flight status, dive status, jump status, etc.) prior to RTD.\nPhysical RTD Screening :\n■Physical exertion testing may be done in office, gym, or PT area.\n■Have the service member perform 2 minutes of supervised aerobic activities at an exertion rate of 16 or greater on\nBorg RPE (Appendix C) .\n●Preferred activities include modified burpees, sit-ups, or jumping jacks, as these activities will stress the vestibular\nsystem. Other activities may include high-knees, step-ups, push-ups, running, elliptical, or exercise bike.\n●Consider simulating combat environment if in a deployed setting.\n●Consider integrating MOS/NEC/AFSC specific-tasks and duty requirements.\n■During exertion, observe service member for overt symptom provocation. If symptoms worsen, stop the test:\n●Remain in Stage 5 and re-test in 48–72 hours as appropriate.\n●Refer to Symptom-Guided  Management  while awaiting re-test.\n■If the re-test is abnormal, refer to higher level of care based on Specialty Referral Guidance .\n■If the Physical RTD Screening is normal, proceed to the Cognitive RTD Screening.\nCognitive RTD Screening :\n■The preferred neurocognitive screening is the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM). If ANAM is unavailable, repeat the Cognitive Exam portion of the MACE 2 (Questions 5\n–16).\n■See ANAM Guidance (Appendix D) for further information.\n7 of 14\nNeurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI)\nInstructions : Please rate the following symptoms with regard to how much they have disturbed you\nSINCE YOUR INJURY .\n0 = None: Rarely if ever present; not a problem at all.\n1 =  Mild: Occasionally present, but it does not disrupt my activities; I can usually continue what\nI’m doing; doesn’t really concern me.\n2 =  Moderate:  Often present, occasionally disrupts my activities; I can usually continue what I’m doing\nwith some effort; I feel somewhat concerned.\n3 =  Severe: Frequently present and disrupts activities; I can only do things that are fairly simple or take\nlittle effort; I feel I need help.\n4 =  Very Severe:  Almost always present and I have been unable to perform at work, school or home due\nto this.\nSymptom None Mild Moderate SevereVery\nSevere\n1.Feeling dizzy 01 2 3 4\n2.Loss of balance 01 2 3 4\n3.Poor Coordination, clumsy 01 2 3 4\n4.Headaches 01 2 3 4\n5.Nausea 01 2 3 4\n6.Vision problems, blurring, trouble seeing 01 2 3 4\n7.Sensitivity to light 01 2 3 4\n8.Hearing dif ficulty 01 2 3 4\n9.Sensitivity to noise 01 2 3 4\n10.

Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation , 10, 1–17. https:/ /dx.doi.org/10.1097/00001199-199510030-00002Appendix A: Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI)\n8 of 14\nFollow-up:\nThe above service member (SM) has been diagnosed with a concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and will be following\nthe TBICoE Progressive Return to Activity (PRA) Protocol throughout recovery. This process is unique in that the SM will progress at their own pace through the protocol but will have a scheduled follow-up  with their provider every three days . Here are a few\ncommon questions related to concussions and this process:\nWhat is the PRA?\nThe PRA is a six-step return to activity protocol. The earliest a SM can be returned to full duty after concussion is seven days. Following a gradual return to duty protocol has been shown to get SMs back to full duty safely and reduce long-term complications.\nWhat could happen if a SM returns to duty too soon?\nReturning a SM too soon places the SM and their unit at risk. Concussion can cause temporary disruption of mental and physical functioning, impairing reaction time, balance, marksmanship, etc. The SM should return to their primary care manager (PCM) and undergo a Return to Duty Screening before they may be returned to full duty.\nWhat is the average recovery time from concussion/mTBI? When can the SM go back to work?\nMost SMs fully recover from concussion. Recovery is different for each person, but most people are back to full duty in 2–4 weeks and will be treated solely by their PCM. However, some SMs may experience more severe symptoms that take longer to resolve and require a referral to a TBI Clinic or specialist.\nWhat does a SM do if there are new or worsening symptoms during the day?\nStop the activity until symptoms resolve. Then, return to the previously tolerated stage for the remainder of the day. The next day, reevaluate symptoms and continue progression through the PRA. Contact the provider with any questions or concerns.How does a SM progress through the stages of the PRA?\nThe SM must spend at least 24 hours in each stage. At the beginning of each day the SM should evaluate how they feel:\n■If symptoms are the same or better compared with the previous day AND  they have no new  symptoms — they can move on\nto the next stage\n■If symptoms are worse compared with the previous day OR  they have new  symptoms – they remain at the current stage for\nan additional 24 hours What are common concussion symptoms?\nThinking/Remembering Physical Emotional/Mood Sleep\nDifficulty concentrating Balance problems Dizziness IrritabilityExcessive daytime\nsleepiness\nDifficulty remembering\nnew informationFeeling tired,\nhaving no energyFuzzy or blurry vision,\ndifficulty readingMore emotional Sleeping less than usual\nDifficulty thinking clearly HeadacheNausea or vomiting\n(early on)Nervousness or anxiety Sleeping more than usual\nFeeling slowed down Sensitivity to noise or light SadnessTrouble falling\nor staying asleepProgressive Return to Activity Following Concussion/mTBI Patient and Leadership Guide (PLG)\nFROM:  _____________________________ TO: ________________________________ DATE:  _________________________________\nRANK/NAME/UNIT:  ______________________________________ DoD ID#:  __________________________________________\nDIAGNOSIS:  Concussion/mTBI Signature:  _________________________________________\nDUTY STATUS:\nQuarters:  q 24 hours  q 48 hours  q 72 hours\nLight Duty/Profile  (per stages chart) for  ___days\nFollow-up Dates/Times:  _________________________________________________________________________________________\nNOTES:  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________Appendix B: Patient and Leadership Guide (PLG)\n9 of 14\nStages of Progressive Return to Activity\nStage Things Service Member Should  Do Things Service Member Should Not  Do\nStage 1 – Relative Rest \u001fLight physical activities that don’t make symptoms\nworse (e.g. walking at easy pace)\nLight leisure activities that don’t make symptoms worse (e.g. TV, reading)\nDo not go to work (SIQ/Quarters)\nNo physical training or exercise\u001fDo not go outside the wire in a combat zone\nNo alcohol\nNo combatives or contact sports\nNo driving\nuntil\ndizziness\nor visual symptoms have resolved\nNo weapons fire or blast exposureStage 2 –\nSymptom-Limited\nActivity\u001fIncrease your physical activity (e.g. take a walk,\nride a stationary bike without resistance, do light household activities)\nLight reading/computer work as tolerated\u001fAvoid crowded areas\nAvoid extreme temperatures\nNo group physical training\nNo resistance/weight training\nStage 3 – Light Activity\nSM may be able to return to work at this stage with limitations based on symptoms\u001fIncrease physical activities (e.g. elliptical or stationary bike without resistance, walk further, lift or carry light loads of less than 20 pounds)\nMore technical reading and computer work, go out in more crowded areas (e.g. grocery shopping)\nStart military speci fic tasks (e.g. clean equipment,\nperform maintenance checks, clean weapons)\u001fNo operating heavy machinery\nNo resistance/weight training\nNo riding in tactical vehicles\nNo alternating shift work or shifts > 8 hours\nStage 4 –  Moderate\nActivity\u001fIncrease physical activities (e.g. non-contact sports, hiking or running, resistance training as tolerated (e.g. push-ups, sit-ups), carry weight across uneven terrain)\nIncrease complexity of military speci fic tasks (e.g.\norienteering/land navigation, following complex instructions, begin wearing personal protective equipment as tolerated)\u001fNo operating heavy machinery\nNo riding in tactical vehicles\nNo alternating shift work or shifts > 8 hours\nStage 5 – Intensive Activity\nSM to follow up with PCM for Return to Duty Screening\u001fGradually increase exposure to high risk activities (e.g. combatives, weapon s fire or blast\nexposure, contact sports) in a supervised training environment based on mission requirements\nResume usual exercise routine and military tasks/training (e.g. use night vision goggles, take part in simulations, navigate uneven terrain/busy environment wit h flak jacket/Kevlar helmet/pack)\u001fNo alternating shift work or shifts > 8 hours\nStage 6 –  Return to\nFull Duty\u001fUnrestricted activityAppendix B: Patient and Leadership Guide (PLG)\n10 of 14Communicate with friends and family members for support\nEat a healthy diet and drink plenty of water\nGet plenty of sleep, and\ntake naps as needed in the early stages\nMaintain or reduce\nuse of caffeine, energy drinks, and nicotine\nTake breaks if needed\n6 No exertion at all\n7–8 Extremely light\n9Very light  exercise.

The earliest\na SM can progress through all six stages and be returned to full duty is 7 days after concussion.\nQuestion : Why should I use a PRA protocol after concussion?\nAnswer : Following a step-wise return to duty protocol has been shown to get SMs back to full duty safely and reduce\nlong-term complications. Returning a SM too soon places the individual and their unit at risk. Concussion can cause\ntemporary disruption of mental and physical functioning, impairing reaction time, balance, marksmanship, etc. The SM should return to their medical provider and undergo a Return to Duty Screening before they may be returned to full duty.\nQuestion : Which patients can benefit from the PRA?\nAnswer : The PRA is designed for use in active-duty SMs who have sustained a concussion/mTBI. However, the PRA is\nappropriate for concussion recovery in civilians or reservists and can be utilized by modifying the activities in each stage to meet the patient’s needs or lifestyle.\nPRA ALGORITHM & PROGRESSION:\nQuestion : Why are the first 3 boxes of the algorithm shaded a different color from the rest of the algorithm and what is their\nsignificance?\nAnswer : The PRA CR has incorporated aspects of the MACE 2 and combined the 2014 PRA for Primary Care Managers,\nthe 2014 PRA for Rehabilitation Providers, and the Concussion Management Tool (CMT) into the PRA Algorithm, creating a more comprehensive product to manage concussion from point of injury to return to full duty. The MACE 2 and components of the CMT are typically used prior to entering the PRA protocol. To indicate this, we shaded the initial management steps a different color. Often, these actions are taken by providers/corpsman/medics that are outside of the SM’s usual medical facility (i.e. emergency department or branch clinic).\nQuestion : What special considerations should I make with SMs that have sustained multiple concussions in the past 12 months?\nAnswer : W\nhen considering the number of concussions the patient has had in the past 12 months, include the current concussion in that number. Per DoDI 6490.11, deployed SMs who have experienced two concussions in the last 12 months must spend a minimum of seven days in the PRA protocol prior to return to full duty. SMs who have experienced 3 or more concussions in the last 12 months must be referred for  Recurrent Concussion Evaluation . T\nhe SM must stop progression at\nStage 5 and can only be returned to full duty (Stage 6) by a specialist.\nQuestion : Why are SMs treated differently if deployed?\nAnswer : If a SM is exposed to a potentially concussive event (PCE) while deployed , DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6490.11\nmandates 24 hours of rest. If the SM is exposed to a PCE while in garrison  and does not  meet criteria for a concussion\n(i.e. mechanism of injury and AOC, LOC, or PTA), 24 hours rest is not mandatory but is still encouraged.\nQuestion : What would you recommend for a SM who is advancing in one area (e.g. physical activity) but struggling in another\narea (e.g. cognitive activity)?\nAnswer : A SM should tolerate activities in both physical/vestibular and cognitive/oculomotor categories prior to advancing\nto the next stage of the PRA. The PCM should use the Symptom-Guided Management table to address specific areas with high symptom burden.\nQuestion : How do you treat a SM who has delayed in presenting to their PCM for days or weeks after a PCE?\nAnswer : First, determine if they have been evaluated for a concussion (e.g. in the emergency department) and if a MACE\n2 has been completed. If a MACE 2 has not been completed, consider performing at the initial evaluation. Then enter the algorithm at the large rectangle labeled “Initiate PRA Stage 1.” Follow the instructions, but rather than beginning at Stage 1, evaluate at which stage the SM should enter the PRA based on the timeframe since the injury and the SM’s activity level and symptoms. Example: It has been seven days since the SM was injured and seen in the ED where a MACE 2 was performed and documented in the EHR. The SM’s overall NSI score is very low (e.g. one for headache and one for dizziness and zeros for all other symptoms), and it is their first concussion in the past 12 months. They report being able to run a half mile before feeling a worsening headache and being able to do push-ups, pull-ups, and light resistance training. Based on these criteria, the SM could enter the PRA at Stage 4 and progress per regular instructions.\nQuestion : I’m concerned that my patient won’t be able to see me every three days. Are there recommendations for how to\naccomplish this?\nAnswer : We strongly recommend scheduling at least five follow-up appointments (every three days) at their first visit. Since\nthe average recovery time for concussion is 15 days, this allows the SM to provide dates and times to their chain of command for awareness and planning. Most patients will complete the entire PRA progression in this time period, though some may require additional recovery time (see risk factors for protracted recovery below). You can also consider utilizing telehealth appointments with the PCM or trained support staff to complete follow-up visits. However, RTD screening will require an in-person appointment. Appendix E: PRA Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n13 of 14\nRETURN TO DUTY CONSIDERATIONS:\nQuestion : What is the Borg scale and how does it compare to heart rate monitoring during exercise?\nAnswer : The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale helps estimate how hard someone is working (activity\nintensity). The Borg RPE can be multiplied by 10 to get a fairly good estimate of the individual’s actual heart rate.1 For\nexample, if the SM is on a treadmill and reports a 13 (Somewhat hard, but it still feels OK to continue), their estimated\nheart rate would be 13 x 10 = 130 bpm. Because this is only an approximation  of heart rate, the actual heart rate can\nvary depending on age and physical condition.\nQuestion : Why is the ANAM part of the RTD screening? What if the ANAM is not available in my setting?\nAnswer : Growing evidence supports the importance of both cognitive and physical readiness for return to duty. The ANAM is a\nneurocognitive assessment tool that has been normed and validated in military SMs. Additionally, many SMs have a baseline ANAM score from before their concussion, which allows for comparison. Thus, the ANAM provides the best evaluation of a SM’s cognitive function in relation to their peers and their own pre-concussion performance. If the ANAM is not available, you can either refer to a nearby MTF that has ANAM testing or repeat the cognitive exam portion of the MACE 2.\nQuestion : I’m deployed, and we need the SM back to duty before they have completed the full PRA for mission readiness.\nWhat should I do?\nAnswer : This clinical recommendation is intended to serve as a guideline, and while strongly encouraged to promote a\nsafe recovery for concussed SMs, these recommendations may be superseded at medical or command discretion.\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:\nQuestion : Why should we avoid using tramadol, acetaminophen/caffeine/butalbital, and opioids in the acute stages of\nconcussion?\nAnswer : All of these medications can cause CNS depression and alter cognitive function, which can mimic other\nconditions associated with traumatic brain injury (e.g. intracranial bleed) and obscure the clinical course of TBI. The sedating effects of these medications can also be intensified in patients with head injury.\n2 In addition, all of these\nmedications carry high risk of dependence, tolerance, and medication overuse (rebound) headaches. Lastly, tramadol and opioids can cause nausea and vomiting, and tramadol may increase the risk of seizures.\nQuestion : Why should we wait 48 hours before using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treatment of post-\ntraumatic headache?\nAnswer : Use of NSAIDs for post-traumatic headache should be delayed for 48 hours following concussion due to their\nanti-platelet effect and the potential risk of exacerbating an evolving intracranial bleed.\nQuestion : Why should SMs minimize consumption of caffeine/energy drinks and nicotine and avoid alcohol after a\nconcussion?\nAnswer : There is limited evidence on the impact of caffeine, energy drinks, nicotine, and alcohol on concussion recovery.\nHowever, these substances can cause dehydration, disrupt sleep patterns, and worsen post-concussion symptoms resulting in a delay in return to duty. Abrupt cessation of caffeine or nicotine may result in withdrawal symptoms, therefore, we recommend SMs minimize or maintain their pre-injury levels of these substances. We recommend abstinence from alcohol as any use may exacerbate concussion symptoms including headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, cognitive disturbances, depression and anxiety. Additionally, excessive alcohol use may increase fall risk, which places a SM at higher risk for a 2\nnd concussion.\nQuestion : My patient is not progressing or is progressing very slowly. What are the risk factors for protracted recovery?\nAnswer : There are several risk factors, both pre- and post-traumatic, associated with protracted recovery following\nconcussion. The most consistent predictor of delayed recovery is the severity of acute and subacute symptoms.3 Pre-\ntraumatic factors include female sex, history of concussion, migraine headaches, sleep disorders, and psychological conditions (including PTSD, anxiety, depression, ADHD, and substance abuse).\n4,5,6 Post-traumatic factors include post-\ntraumatic migraine/headache and acute dizziness.3,4 Particularly relevant in the military population is the prevalence of\nPTSD and its potential impact on concussion recovery. The risk for PTSD is elevated two-to-three fold following concussion, and the prevalence of co-morbid PTSD and TBI has been reported to range from 10-40%.\n7,8 During early\nconcussion care, providers should be aware of risk factors for PTSD, including acute stress disorder (ASD), which is diagnosed when acute stress reaction (ASR) or combat or operational stress reaction (COSR) persists beyond three days. Refer to the VA/DoD PTSD and ASD Clinical Practice Guideline for more information on ASR, ASD, and PTSD.\nQuestion : When is it safe for a SM to have sexual intercourse following a concussion?\nAnswer : Sexual activity can be slowly reintroduced, as with other strenuous activity, during progression through the\nstages. It is safe to have sex when the SM is able to do so without exacerbating symptoms. Consider fatigue, mood, and dizziness in addition to other physical symptoms. During recovery, SMs may wish to modify sexual activity (e.g. position, frequency, intensity) in order to minimize symptoms. Appendix E: PRA Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n14 of 14"

Return To Duty (RTD) Screening :\n ■Before returning to full duty, SM should pass the Physical AND Cognitive RTD Screenings to ensure mission readiness.\n ■These tests should be performed after the service member has spent a minimum of 24 hours in Stage 5 without new or \nworsening symptoms.\n ■The purpose of the RTD screening is to give the provider a way to objectively measure readiness for return to duty. This may be used in conjunction with patient’s subjective history of tolerated physical and cognitive activities.\n ■Consider MOS/NEC/AFSC service specific return to duty requirements (e.g. flight status, dive status, jump status, etc.) prior to RTD.\n  Physical RTD Screening :\n ■Physical exertion testing may be done in office, gym, or PT area. \n ■Have the service member perform 2 minutes of supervised aerobic activities at an exertion rate of 16 or greater on  \nBorg RPE (Appendix C) .\n ●Preferred activities include modified burpees, sit-ups, or jumping jacks, as these activities will stress the vestibular \nsystem. Other activities may include high-knees, step-ups, push-ups, running, elliptical, or exercise bike.\n ●Consider simulating combat environment if in a deployed setting.\n ●Consider integrating MOS/NEC/AFSC specific-tasks and duty requirements.\n ■During exertion, observe service member for overt symptom provocation. If symptoms worsen, stop the test:\n ●Remain in Stage 5 and re-test in 48–72 hours as appropriate.\n ●Refer to Symptom-Guided  Management  while awaiting re-test.\n ■If the re-test is abnormal, refer to higher level of care based on Specialty Referral Guidance .\n ■If the Physical RTD Screening is normal, proceed to the Cognitive RTD Screening.\n  Cognitive RTD Screening :\n ■The preferred neurocognitive screening is the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM). If ANAM is unavailable, repeat the Cognitive Exam portion of the MACE 2 (Questions 5\n–16).\n ■See ANAM Guidance (Appendix D) for further information.\n7 of 14\nNeurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI)\nInstructions : Please rate the following symptoms with regard to how much they have disturbed you \nSINCE YOUR INJURY .\n0 = None: Rarely if ever present; not a problem at all.\n1 =  Mild: Occasionally present, but it does not disrupt my activities; I can usually continue what \nI’m doing; doesn’t really concern me.\n2 =  Moderate:  Often present, occasionally disrupts my activities; I can usually continue what I’m doing \nwith some effort; I feel somewhat concerned. \n3 =  Severe: Frequently present and disrupts activities; I can only do things that are fairly simple or take \nlittle effort; I feel I need help.\n4 =  Very Severe:  Almost always present and I have been unable to perform at work, school or home due \nto this.\nSymptom None Mild Moderate SevereVery \nSevere\n1.Feeling dizzy 01 2 3 4\n2.Loss of balance 01 2 3 4\n3.Poor Coordination, clumsy 01 2 3 4\n4.Headaches 01 2 3 4\n5.Nausea 01 2 3 4\n6.Vision problems, blurring, trouble seeing 01 2 3 4\n7.Sensitivity to light 01 2 3 4\n8.Hearing dif ficulty 01 2 3 4\n9.Sensitivity to noise 01 2 3 4\n10.

This process is unique in that the SM will progress at their own pace through the protocol but will have a scheduled follow-up  with their provider every three days . Here are a few \ncommon questions related to concussions and this process:\nWhat is the PRA? \nThe PRA is a six-step return to activity protocol. The earliest a SM can be returned to full duty after concussion is seven days. Following a gradual return to duty protocol has been shown to get SMs back to full duty safely and reduce long-term complications.\nWhat could happen if a SM returns to duty too soon?\nReturning a SM too soon places the SM and their unit at risk. Concussion can cause temporary disruption of mental and physical functioning, impairing reaction time, balance, marksmanship, etc. The SM should return to their primary care manager (PCM) and undergo a Return to Duty Screening before they may be returned to full duty.\nWhat is the average recovery time from concussion/mTBI? When can the SM go back to work? \nMost SMs fully recover from concussion. Recovery is different for each person, but most people are back to full duty in 2–4 weeks and will be treated solely by their PCM. However, some SMs may experience more severe symptoms that take longer to resolve and require a referral to a TBI Clinic or specialist. \nWhat does a SM do if there are new or worsening symptoms during the day? \nStop the activity until symptoms resolve. Then, return to the previously tolerated stage for the remainder of the day. The next day, reevaluate symptoms and continue progression through the PRA. Contact the provider with any questions or concerns.How does a SM progress through the stages of the PRA?\nThe SM must spend at least 24 hours in each stage. At the beginning of each day the SM should evaluate how they feel: \n ■If symptoms are the same or better compared with the previous day AND  they have no new  symptoms — they can move on \nto the next stage\n ■If symptoms are worse compared with the previous day OR  they have new  symptoms – they remain at the current stage for \nan additional 24 hours What are common concussion symptoms?

The earliest \na SM can progress through all six stages and be returned to full duty is 7 days after concussion. \nQuestion : Why should I use a PRA protocol after concussion? \nAnswer : Following a step-wise return to duty protocol has been shown to get SMs back to full duty safely and reduce \nlong-term complications. Returning a SM too soon places the individual and their unit at risk. Concussion can cause \ntemporary disruption of mental and physical functioning, impairing reaction time, balance, marksmanship, etc. The SM should return to their medical provider and undergo a Return to Duty Screening before they may be returned to full duty. \nQuestion : Which patients can benefit from the PRA? \nAnswer : The PRA is designed for use in active-duty SMs who have sustained a concussion/mTBI. However, the PRA is \nappropriate for concussion recovery in civilians or reservists and can be utilized by modifying the activities in each stage to meet the patient’s needs or lifestyle. \nPRA ALGORITHM & PROGRESSION: \nQuestion : Why are the first 3 boxes of the algorithm shaded a different color from the rest of the algorithm and what is their \nsignificance? \nAnswer : The PRA CR has incorporated aspects of the MACE 2 and combined the 2014 PRA for Primary Care Managers, \nthe 2014 PRA for Rehabilitation Providers, and the Concussion Management Tool (CMT) into the PRA Algorithm, creating a more comprehensive product to manage concussion from point of injury to return to full duty. The MACE 2 and components of the CMT are typically used prior to entering the PRA protocol. To indicate this, we shaded the initial management steps a different color. Often, these actions are taken by providers/corpsman/medics that are outside of the SM’s usual medical facility (i.e. emergency department or branch clinic). \nQuestion : What special considerations should I make with SMs that have sustained multiple concussions in the past 12 months?\nAnswer : W\nhen considering the number of concussions the patient has had in the past 12 months, include the current concussion in that number. Per DoDI 6490.11, deployed SMs who have experienced two concussions in the last 12 months must spend a minimum of seven days in the PRA protocol prior to return to full duty. SMs who have experienced 3 or more concussions in the last 12 months must be referred for  Recurrent Concussion Evaluation . T\n he SM must stop progression at \nStage 5 and can only be returned to full duty (Stage 6) by a specialist.\nQuestion : Why are SMs treated differently if deployed?\nAnswer : If a SM is exposed to a potentially concussive event (PCE) while deployed , DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6490.11 \nmandates 24 hours of rest. If the SM is exposed to a PCE while in garrison  and does not  meet criteria for a concussion \n(i.e. mechanism of injury and AOC, LOC, or PTA), 24 hours rest is not mandatory but is still encouraged.\nQuestion : What would you recommend for a SM who is advancing in one area (e.g. physical activity) but struggling in another \narea (e.g. cognitive activity)? \nAnswer : A SM should tolerate activities in both physical/vestibular and cognitive/oculomotor categories prior to advancing \nto the next stage of the PRA. The PCM should use the Symptom-Guided Management table to address specific areas with high symptom burden. \nQuestion : How do you treat a SM who has delayed in presenting to their PCM for days or weeks after a PCE?\nAnswer : First, determine if they have been evaluated for a concussion (e.g. in the emergency department) and if a MACE \n2 has been completed. If a MACE 2 has not been completed, consider performing at the initial evaluation. Then enter the algorithm at the large rectangle labeled “Initiate PRA Stage 1.” Follow the instructions, but rather than beginning at Stage 1, evaluate at which stage the SM should enter the PRA based on the timeframe since the injury and the SM’s activity level and symptoms. Example: It has been seven days since the SM was injured and seen in the ED where a MACE 2 was performed and documented in the EHR. The SM’s overall NSI score is very low (e.g. one for headache and one for dizziness and zeros for all other symptoms), and it is their first concussion in the past 12 months. They report being able to run a half mile before feeling a worsening headache and being able to do push-ups, pull-ups, and light resistance training. Based on these criteria, the SM could enter the PRA at Stage 4 and progress per regular instructions. \nQuestion : I’m concerned that my patient won’t be able to see me every three days. Are there recommendations for how to \naccomplish this?\nAnswer : We strongly recommend scheduling at least five follow-up appointments (every three days) at their first visit. Since \nthe average recovery time for concussion is 15 days, this allows the SM to provide dates and times to their chain of command for awareness and planning. Most patients will complete the entire PRA progression in this time period, though some may require additional recovery time (see risk factors for protracted recovery below). You can also consider utilizing telehealth appointments with the PCM or trained support staff to complete follow-up visits. However, RTD screening will require an in-person appointment. Appendix E: PRA Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n13 of 14\nRETURN TO DUTY CONSIDERATIONS:\nQuestion : What is the Borg scale and how does it compare to heart rate monitoring during exercise?\nAnswer : The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale helps estimate how hard someone is working (activity \nintensity). The Borg RPE can be multiplied by 10 to get a fairly good estimate of the individual’s actual heart rate.1 For \nexample, if the SM is on a treadmill and reports a 13 (Somewhat hard, but it still feels OK to continue), their estimated \nheart rate would be 13 x 10 = 130 bpm. Because this is only an approximation  of heart rate, the actual heart rate can \nvary depending on age and physical condition. \nQuestion : Why is the ANAM part of the RTD screening? What if the ANAM is not available in my setting?\nAnswer : Growing evidence supports the importance of both cognitive and physical readiness for return to duty. The ANAM is a \nneurocognitive assessment tool that has been normed and validated in military SMs. Additionally, many SMs have a baseline ANAM score from before their concussion, which allows for comparison. Thus, the ANAM provides the best evaluation of a SM’s cognitive function in relation to their peers and their own pre-concussion performance. If the ANAM is not available, you can either refer to a nearby MTF that has ANAM testing or repeat the cognitive exam portion of the MACE 2. \nQuestion : I’m deployed, and we need the SM back to duty before they have completed the full PRA for mission readiness. \nWhat should I do?\nAnswer : This clinical recommendation is intended to serve as a guideline, and while strongly encouraged to promote a \nsafe recovery for concussed SMs, these recommendations may be superseded at medical or command discretion. \nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS: \nQuestion : Why should we avoid using tramadol, acetaminophen/caffeine/butalbital, and opioids in the acute stages of \nconcussion?\nAnswer : All of these medications can cause CNS depression and alter cognitive function, which can mimic other \nconditions associated with traumatic brain injury (e.g. intracranial bleed) and obscure the clinical course of TBI. The sedating effects of these medications can also be intensified in patients with head injury.\n2 In addition, all of these \nmedications carry high risk of dependence, tolerance, and medication overuse (rebound) headaches. Lastly, tramadol and opioids can cause nausea and vomiting, and tramadol may increase the risk of seizures.\nQuestion : Why should we wait 48 hours before using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treatment of post-\ntraumatic headache?\nAnswer : Use of NSAIDs for post-traumatic headache should be delayed for 48 hours following concussion due to their \nanti-platelet effect and the potential risk of exacerbating an evolving intracranial bleed.\nQuestion : Why should SMs minimize consumption of caffeine/energy drinks and nicotine and avoid alcohol after a \nconcussion? \nAnswer : There is limited evidence on the impact of caffeine, energy drinks, nicotine, and alcohol on concussion recovery. \nHowever, these substances can cause dehydration, disrupt sleep patterns, and worsen post-concussion symptoms resulting in a delay in return to duty. Abrupt cessation of caffeine or nicotine may result in withdrawal symptoms, therefore, we recommend SMs minimize or maintain their pre-injury levels of these substances. We recommend abstinence from alcohol as any use may exacerbate concussion symptoms including headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, cognitive disturbances, depression and anxiety. Additionally, excessive alcohol use may increase fall risk, which places a SM at higher risk for a 2\nnd concussion.\nQuestion : My patient is not progressing or is progressing very slowly. What are the risk factors for protracted recovery? \nAnswer : There are several risk factors, both pre- and post-traumatic, associated with protracted recovery following \nconcussion. The most consistent predictor of delayed recovery is the severity of acute and subacute symptoms.3 Pre-\ntraumatic factors include female sex, history of concussion, migraine headaches, sleep disorders, and psychological conditions (including PTSD, anxiety, depression, ADHD, and substance abuse).\n4,5,6 Post-traumatic factors include post-\ntraumatic migraine/headache and acute dizziness.3,4 Particularly relevant in the military population is the prevalence of \nPTSD and its potential impact on concussion recovery. The risk for PTSD is elevated two-to-three fold following concussion, and the prevalence of co-morbid PTSD and TBI has been reported to range from 10-40%.\n7,8 During early \nconcussion care, providers should be aware of risk factors for PTSD, including acute stress disorder (ASD), which is diagnosed when acute stress reaction (ASR) or combat or operational stress reaction (COSR) persists beyond three days. Refer to the VA/DoD PTSD and ASD Clinical Practice Guideline for more information on ASR, ASD, and PTSD. \nQuestion : When is it safe for a SM to have sexual intercourse following a concussion? \nAnswer : Sexual activity can be slowly reintroduced, as with other strenuous activity, during progression through the \nstages. It is safe to have sex when the SM is able to do so without exacerbating symptoms. Consider fatigue, mood, and dizziness in addition to other physical symptoms. During recovery, SMs may wish to modify sexual activity (e.g. position, frequency, intensity) in order to minimize symptoms. Appendix E: PRA Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n14 of 14\n",

JOINT TRAUMA SYSTEM CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE (JTS CPG)\nInvasive Fungal Infection in War Wounds CPG ID: 28\nBACKGROUND\nClinically significant infections, including invasive fungal wound infections (IFIs), have occurred in the\nDoD’s wounded warrior patient population since the beginning of the current conflicts in Iraq and\nAfghanistan. During 2009 -2010, a substantial increase in the incidence of IFIs was observed among\nmilitary personnel with wounds sustained in Afghanistan, corresponding to a greater frequency of improvised explosive device blast injuries sustained while on foot patrol in Helmand and Kandahar provinces.\n1-3 Mold contamination of the wounds was associated with regions in southern Afghanistan\ncharacterized by lower elevation, warmer temperatures,4 and followed waterways. Of part icular clinical\nconcern was an apparent association between patient outcome and the presence of angioinvasive filamentous fungi (e.g., order Mucorales, Aspergillus species, and Fusarium species) often called “molds .”\n5,6 In general, IFIs are devastating infections associated with increased mortality, morbidity,\nlimb loss, and prolonged hospitalization for survivors.2,7-10 In civilian literature, mortality rates have\nbeen reported as high as 38%.5 Among the military population, the crude mortality rate was as high as\n8% during the first two years of increased prevalence.11 Dismounted blast injuries were highly\ncontaminated with debris (e.g., soil, plant matter, and shrapnel) and coinfection with bacteria and other\nfungi was common.12-14\nFollowing recognit ion of the high number of IFI cases, the Joint Trauma System, in collaboration with the\nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program (IDCRP)  Trauma Infectious Disease Outcomes Study (TIDOS), launched an outbreak investigation. Review of the findings demonstrated that the most common mechanistic and clinical factors associated with IFI included dismounted blast injury, above-knee traumatic amputations, extensive perineal/pelvic injury (observed trend, but not statistically significant), and massive packed red blood cell transfusion\n(≥20 units in the first 24 hours).\n1,2 Importantly, all IFI patients had a suspicious wound (i.e. unhealthy\nappearance), defined as recurrent tissue necrosis following at least t wo surgical debridements.\nAdditional work on IFI classification emphasizes the temporal relationship between surgical findings and laboratory evidence of IFI. ( See Appendix A: Examples of Suspicious Wounds.)\n15\nThe morbidity associated with IFI in war wounds, which may include significant tissue loss, necessitates early surgical and antifungal\ntreatment of patients identified as high risk. Early and aggressive debridement of devitalized tissue and removal of debris are universally accepted as the most important interventions. Patients\nfrequently require surgical amputations and/or amputation\nrevisions, which i nclude extending to more proximal levels (e.g.,\ntranstibi al to transfemoral or transfemoral  to proximal  transfemoral, hi p disarticulation,  or\nhemipelvectomy.16 IFI wounds with order Mucorales and Gram-negative bacterial co-infections were\nobserved to have longer ti me to wound closure, highlighting the need for antifungal  and antibacterial\ntherapy.14\nThe 3 main principle s of IF I treatment :\n1.Su\nrgical debridement of infected tissue;\n2.Minimization of immunosuppression (e.g., avoidance of malnutrition or excessive blood product\ntransfusion) ; and\n3.Utilization of empiric dual antifungal medications (e.g., amphotericin B and a broad -spectrum\ntriazole agent) when there is a strong suspicion of an IFI.9\nEarly and aggressive\ndebridement of devitalized\ntissue and removal of debris are\nuniversally accepted as the most important interventions .\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 2\nInvasive Fungal Infection in War Wounds CPG ID: 28\nWounds with IFI require a significantly higher number of surgical (not bedside) debridement compared\nto other wound infections. There are also more changes in amputation level (e.g. , revision of a\ntransfemoral amputation to either a hemipelvectomy or hip disarticulation); longer duration following\ninjury to wound closure; and an increased frequency of return to the operating room after wound closure due to infectious complications or drainage.\n12 The role of topical antifungal therapy in the\nprevention of IFI is not clear, but topical therapies have not been demonstrated to have adverse local or systemic effects.\nEVALUATION AND TREATMENT\nThe most important aspect of evaluation and treatment of war wounds is a high index of suspicion for fungal infection, with the early recognition of unhealthy or suspicious wounds followed by early, aggressive, and repetitive surgical debridement of all devitalized tissue and organic material.\nAfter initial debridement, risk factors for invasive fungal infection will be assessed. Identified risk factors\ninclude:\nDismounted blast injury.\nAbove-knee immediate traumatic amputation, or progressive transition from below -knee to\nthrough -knee to above-knee amputation.\nExtensive perineal, genitourinary, and/or rectal inj ury.\nMassive transfusion > 20 units packed red blood cells within 24 hours of injury.\nExtensive deep-partial -thickness or full -thickness burns (note: covered elsewhere).\n17\nDIAGNOSIS  CRITERIA\nDiagnostic criteria for an IFI are:\n1. Presence of a traumatic wo und(s) .\n2. Recurrent necrosis following at least two consecutive surgical debridements .\n3. Laboratory evidence of fungal infection following at least two surgical debridements (i.e. mold\nculture positivity and/or histopathology indicating tissue invasion).9,15 This is usually not\navailable at deployed Role 2 or Role 3 Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs), so clinical suspicion is key to early intervention.\n4. Fungal wound infection is often manifested by ‘tinctorial’ or color changes in a wound; early detection of such changes requires repeated inspection by an experienced clinician.\n18\n5. IFIs are often diagnosed through routine histopathological examination of tissue specimens. The evaluation of the performance of periodic acid -Schiff (PAS) and Gomori methenamine sil ver\n(GMS) in combat trauma -associated IFI demonstrated that the two stains were 84% concordant\nwith false negative rates of 44% for PAS and 15% for GMS; however, neither stain was significantly superior at identifying fungal elements. Overall, there is no added benefit for increasing diagnostic yield with use of both stains.\n19\n6. Where available, pan-fungal PCR, for identification of filamentous fungi evaluation offers\npromise for rapid identification of IFI which can lead to a more timely and accurate diagno sis.\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 3\nInvasive Fungal Infection in War Wounds CPG ID: 28\nCompared to histopathology, panfungal PCR was specific (99%), but not as sensitive (63%);\nhowever, sensitivity improved to 83% in specimens from sites with angioinvasion.19\nTOPICAL TREATMENT\nInitiate topical antifungal therapy on patients with at least three of the above risk factors above in Evaluation and Treatment.\n20,22 There is no clear evidence that any topical treatment improves\noutcomes; however, Dakin’s Solution is commonly used. Dakin’s used an irrigation solution, which is how it was ori ginally described for use, is likely beneficial for severe infections, including fungal\ninfections. Use Dakin’s solution in lieu of saline irrigations for patients meeting criteria.\n23,24\nIn terms of wound dressings in patients with concern for IFI, nothin g has been definitively proven to\nimprove outcomes, but using a topical antifungal is still conditionally recommended. Options include Dakin’s-soaked Kerlix dressings, Silver Nitrate Solution, or honey\n.20,22- 28 VAC (negative pressure wound\ndressings) are not recommended early in the treatment of IFI, or suspected IFI, because daily trips to the\noperating room are needed for debridement/washout, diagnostics, and source control.\nUse of Dakin’s solution in the prevention or treatment of IFI, though widespre ad and probably\nsuperior to saline or dry gauze, is unproven. At the US Army Burn Center, a 0.5% aqueous solution of silver nitrate, rather than Dakin’s solution, is the preferred treatment for open wounds at risk of IFI.\nEstablished IFIs may be treated wi th topical Nystatin powder. Topical Silver Nitrate is not always\navailable in the deployed environment.\n29\nA standardized operative note for wound description is available and should be used throughout the continuum of care for patients at increased risk for IFI. Utilization of this operative note may facilitate the early detection of sequential wound necrosis , which is the crucial first sign of IFI – Appendix B .\nDescription of Bastion Classification of lower limb injuries is presented in Appendix C . Document on the\nfirst page of the Operative Note.\nDEBRIDEMENT  AND  ANTIFUNGAL  THERAPY\n1. For patients transferred to any Role 3 strategic evacuation hub, risk factors for IFI should be\nassessed and ongoing resuscitation requirements should be addressed as needed. The patient should undergo surgical examination, wound washout, and debridement (if indicated) within 6 -\n12 hours of arrival. Dakin ’s wound irrigations  and topical antifungal treatments as described\nabove should be initiated/continued.\n2. Evacuation should be deferred in patients who are clinically unstable and require debridement / wound care every 6-12 hours. Reassess patient to meet evacuation criteria every 24 hours. The\nsurgeon on call should be contacted to evaluate the patient and their wounds immediately on arrival to the next level of care.\n3. Upon arrival to the Role 4 MTF (i.e. regional treatment facility outside of the combat z one, but\nprior to arrival in the United States), the patient should undergo operative exploration, wound washout, and debridement (as indicated) within 6 -12 hours. Obtain histopathology and\nmicrobiology specimens on all patients with at least three risk fa ctors for IFI and any with clinical\nsuspicion. Topical antifungal therapy should be continued.\n4. Upon arrival to an MTF in the United States, the patient should undergo surgical exploration, wound washout, and debridement within 6 -12 hours. Obtain histopathology and microbiology\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 4\nInvasive Fungal Infection in War Wounds CPG ID: 28\nspecimens on all patients with at least three risk factors for IFI and/or who have an unhealthy\nwound appearance (e.g.,  tissue necrosis). Topical antifungal  dressings may be discontinued at\nany l evel of care when the treating surgeon observes healthy granulation, or when\nhistopathology an d cultures are ne gative for fungal  infection o r colonization.\n5.Follo\nwing the first two debridements in theater, if tissue necrosis is observed in wounds afte r\nt\nwo consecutive debridements, start broad -spectrum antifungal and antibiotic medication s\nim\nmediately and obtain infectious disease consultation. Liposomal amphotericin B is th e\npr\nimary choice due to its effectiveness against mucormycosis, and its reduced potential t o\ni\nnduce nephrotoxicity compared to the non -liposomal formulation.30 Although voriconazole i s\ni\nneffective against mucormycosis, it has shown to be an active agent against molds that ar e\nr\nesistant to amphotericin B (e.g., Aspergillus terreus and Scedosporium prolificans ).31\n6.I n general, patients with IFI are severely injured, and intravenous formulations of antifunga l\na\ngents are prescribed due to concern for inadequate gastrointestinal antifungal absorption i n\nt\nhe septic patient. As soon as feasible, parameters for monitoring antifungal drug toxiciti es\ns\nhould be implemented (EKG, renal function and LFTs) .\n7.W\nhen voriconazole is administered intravenously, it requires a solubilizing excipient (i.e .\ns\nulfobutyl ether β-cyclodextrin), which may accumulate in patients with impaired renal function .\nA\nblack box warning has been issued due to adverse effects of the accumulating solute in a n\na\nnimal model. Nevertheless, the effects of elevated sulfobutyl ether β-cyclodextrin are unknow n\ni\nn humans.32 An IV route of administration of voriconazole did not predict worsening rena l\nd\nysfunction in a small retrospective study with the caveat that only a few patients receive d\nv\noriconazole for ≥ 7 days.33 Clinical experience to date has not shown permanent rena l\ni\nmpairment with this off -label use of voriconazole in the wounded military population.34\n8.Po saconazole is another triazole agent that has been found to have a 60 -70% response rate as  a\ns\nalvage regimen against mucormycosis when prescribed orally.35-37 Posaconazole tablets ar e\np\nreferred over oral suspension as there is less variability in absorption. Therapeutic dru g\nmo\nnitoring should be used if available to achieve trough concentrations > 1.0 µg/mL.38\nRecently, an intravenous formulation was approved and has shown to be useful.39\nThe recommended d ose of p osaconazoIe (tablet f ormulation) i s 300mg by mo uth every 12 hours fo r 2\ndoses, t hen 3 00mg onc e daily. A posaconazole trough s hould b e obtained on day 7 o f therapy. Note\nthat i f other formulations of posaconazole are used, the dosing will  be different.\nThe typical st arting dose of voriconazoIe i s 6 mg / kg IV every 12 hours for 2 doses, followed by 4 mg/\nkg (the patient's a ctual  body w eight s hould b e used for d osing). A v oriconazoIe t rough s hould b e\nobtained o n day 4 o f therapy. Goa l trough i s 1 - 1.5 mcg / mL .\n9.D ual administration of liposomal amphotericin B and a broad -spectrum triazole is recommende d\nas t\nhe first -line antifungal agents. Among triazoles, clinical experience has been primarily wit h\nv\noriconazole. Many of the wounds incurred by combat casualties grow more than one mold.32\nFurthermore, prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics covering both gram- positive and gram-\nnegative organisms (e.g., vancomycin and meropenem)are prescribed as fungal -infecte d\nw\nounds frequently also have bacterial growt h\nIn\nitial studies have shown that combat IFI wound cultures growing order Mucorales will have  a\ns\necond non -Mucorales fungus present 30% of the time. Aspergillus species is more difficult t o\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 5\nInvasive Fungal Infection in War Wounds CPG ID: 28\ngrow than order Mucorales but should be suspected and empirically treated initially as it has\nbeen shown to be virulent in this patient population.40 Therefore, dual use of a broad -spectrum\ntriazole and liposomal amphotericin B is suggested for wounds infected with either or both of these fungi. If long-term treatment is required, the antifungal medications should be targeted based on culture results.\n10. Isavuconazole is a triazole agent available in IV and oral formulations with mold activity including against mucormycosis. Isavuconazole has not been studied in randomized controlled\ntrials but in one multicenter open-label single -arm study, isavuconazole demonstrated similar\nefficacy to amphotericin B formulations in an external matched control group.\n40\n11. Particular attention should be given to aggressive debridement of non -viable tissue at each\ndebridement proced ure. The extent of necrosis and appearance of the wound before and after\ncompletion of the operation should be documented in the operative note. Appendix B shows a\nstandardized operative note for wound d escription to be used for patients at increased risk for\nIFI. Whenever a significant amount of necrotic tissue is debrided, repeat debridement should be\nperformed in 24 hours or less.\nAs aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic and infected tissue r emains the mainstay of\ntreatment for IFI, surgical exploration and debridement should continue at least every 24 hours\nuntil cessation of necrosis occurs.  Wound coverage and closure should not occur until after the\nwound is clean, contracting, and granula ting.\n12. If angioinvasive fungal elements or fungal elements among tissue are reported on histopathology, or if cultures are positive in the setting of recurrent necrosis, initiate (or continue) treatment with systemic antifungal medications. Treatment will r equire close\nconsultation with infectious disease; however, as a general guideline, stop systemic antifungal\nmedications if the wound remains clean/viable for two weeks and if the patient remains clinically stable. If the patient has a fungal infection in more than one body region (e.g., extremity/pelvis, abdomen, and chest), long-term treatment may be indicated.\nBIOPSY AND TISSUE CULTURE IN OR\nBiopsy should be done at the time of wound exploration (after initial surgical debridement) once the casualty has been evacuated from the theater of conflict (in theater if patient evacuation is delayed) and repeated on subsequent explorations if there are persistent findings (e.g., sepsis physiology, wound\nnecrosis) raising suspicion for IFI.\n1. Tissue samp les should be obtained from each lower extremity in patients with bilateral lower\nextremity amputations. Sample all suspected areas.\n2. Other sites sampled should be at the discretion of the operative surgeon.\n3. At least one specimen should be taken from the ju nction of viable and necrotic tissue (the last\npiece of borderline -viable tissue removed).\n4. For each site sampled, two tissue samples will be collected fresh in two separate sterile\nspecimen containers.\nOne specimen (1 cm3) for “rush” histopathological examination\nOne specimen (1 cm3) for fungal and bacterial culture\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 6\nInvasive Fungal Infection in War Wounds CPG ID: 28\nOR  STAFF  RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe histopathology specimen is placed in formalin. It is not necessary to send fresh samples.\nOrder histopathology and cultures (aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal). Special studies are not routinely\ndone, but may be requested (e.g., mycobacterial and viral).\n1. Clearly label specimens.  Labels contain the following information:\nSite (e.g., left lower extremity)\nPatient’s name, date of birth, and hospital identification number\nDate and time obtained\n“Rush” sticker if available\nInitials of the person labelling the container\n2. Directly contact the on -call pathologist to let them know they will receive a “rush”\nhistopathology specimen for IFI shortly. Deliver the histopathology specimen to the pathology\nlab immediately.\nPATHOLOGY  STAFF  RESPONSIBILITIES\nPathology staff will coordinate processing as rapidly as possible (≤ 24 hours).\n1. Histopathological specimen will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and GMS/PAS stains and evaluated for (1) presence of fungal elements; (2) presence of fungal elements in viable or non-viable tissue; (3) presence of angioinvasion.\n2. Microbiological specimen will be cultured for aerobes, anaerobes, and fungi.\n3. Mycobacterial and/or viral cultures will not be done routinely under this protocol but may be done with special request.\nNOTE:\nFungus can take up to six weeks to grow in culture medium. Therefore, it is recommended that the\ncultures be checked frequently for two weeks; then once a week for four additional weeks before they are considered final.  In addition, wounds without recurre nt tissue necrosis may have mold\ncolonization and not a true infection.\n41\nTissue preparation for culturing typically destroys the ribbon-like hyphal elements of fungi belonging to the order Mucorales, reducing growth. The microbiology laboratory should be notified that an IFI is\nsuspected so samples are handled appropriately to maximize culture yield.\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 7\nPERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT (PI) MONITORING\nPOPULATION  OF INTEREST\nIdentify patients with IFI\nPatients with 3 or more risk factors for invasive fungal infection (dismounted blast, above knee\namputation, perineal genitourinary or rectal injury, MT> 20 units RBC + WB within 24h of injury.)\nINTENT (EXPECTED OUTCOMES)\nPatients with ≥3 IFI risk factors undergo surgical debridement undergo surgical debridement in\nthe OR within 6 -12 hours of arrival at Role 3 or 4 MTFs.\nPatients with ≥3 IFI risk factors and wounds concerning for IFI are:\ntaken to the OR at least every 24 hours\nare started on IV or PO antifungals.\nAn operative note for wound debridement includes the extent of necrosis quantified as a\npercentage of each wound.\nPERFORMANCE/ADHERENCE  METRICS\nNumber and percentage of patients in the population of interest who undergo surgical debridement in the OR within 6 -12 hours of arrival at Role 3 or 4 M TFs.\nNumber and percentage of patients in the population of interest who have an operative note that quantifies the extent of wound necrosis as a percentage of each wound.\nDATA  SOURCES\nPatient Record\nDepartment of Defense Trauma Registry (DoDTR)\nSYSTEM REPORTING & FREQUENCY\nThe above constitutes the minimum criteria for PI monitoring of this CPG.

However, under Federal law, in some\ncircumstances, unapproved uses of approved drugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part of clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved uses may also be subject to speci al regulations.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS\nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement.\nFurther, it does not imply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care\npractitioners or considers it to be the “standard of care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is\nto inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner- patient relationship.\nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES\nBalanced Discussion\nConsistent with this purpose, CPG dis cussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not\napproved by the FDA. Further, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical\nstudy data, including any such data that suggest caution in the use of the product and specifically\nincluding any FDA -issued warnings.\nQuality Assurance Monitoring\nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance\nmonitoring of outcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of\naccurate clinical records is underscored.\nInformation to Patients\nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing\nan unusual off -label use will address the issue of informa tion to patients. When practicable,\nconsideration will be given to including in an appendix an appropriate information sheet for distribution\nto patients, whether before or after use of the product. Information to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a DoD health care practitioner\nwould decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with such use.\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 17"

During 2009 -2010, a substantial increase in the incidence of IFIs was observed among \nmilitary personnel with wounds sustained in Afghanistan, corresponding to a greater frequency of improvised explosive device blast injuries sustained while on foot patrol in Helmand and Kandahar provinces.\n1-3 Mold contamination of the wounds was associated with regions in southern Afghanistan \ncharacterized by lower elevation, warmer temperatures,4 and followed waterways. Of part icular clinical \nconcern was an apparent association between patient outcome and the presence of angioinvasive filamentous fungi (e.g., order Mucorales, Aspergillus species, and Fusarium species) often called “molds .”\n5,6 In general, IFIs are devastating infections associated with increased mortality, morbidity, \nlimb loss, and prolonged hospitalization for survivors.2,7-10 In civilian literature, mortality rates have \nbeen reported as high as 38%.5 Among the military population, the crude mortality rate was as high as \n8% during the first two years of increased prevalence.11 Dismounted blast injuries were highly \ncontaminated with debris (e.g., soil, plant matter, and shrapnel) and coinfection with bacteria and other \nfungi was common.12-14 \nFollowing recognit ion of the high number of IFI cases, the Joint Trauma System, in collaboration with the \nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program (IDCRP)  Trauma Infectious Disease Outcomes Study (TIDOS), launched an outbreak investigation. Review of the findings demonstrated that the most common mechanistic and clinical factors associated with IFI included dismounted blast injury, above-knee traumatic amputations, extensive perineal/pelvic injury (observed trend, but not statistically significant), and massive packed red blood cell transfusion \n(≥20 units in the first 24 hours).\n1,2 Importantly, all IFI patients had a suspicious wound (i.e. unhealthy \nappearance), defined as recurrent tissue necrosis following at least t wo surgical debridements. \nAdditional work on IFI classification emphasizes the temporal relationship between surgical findings and laboratory evidence of IFI. ( See Appendix A: Examples of Suspicious Wounds.)\n15 \nThe morbidity associated with IFI in war wounds, which may include significant tissue loss, necessitates early surgical and antifungal \ntreatment of patients identified as high risk. Early and aggressive debridement of devitalized tissue and removal of debris are universally accepted as the most important interventions. Patients \nfrequently require surgical amputations and/or amputation \nrevisions, which i nclude extending to more proximal levels (e.g., \ntranstibi al to transfemoral or transfemoral  to proximal  transfemoral, hi p disarticulation,  or \nhemipelvectomy.16 IFI wounds with order Mucorales and Gram-negative bacterial co-infections were \nobserved to have longer ti me to wound closure, highlighting the need for antifungal  and antibacterial \ntherapy.14 \nThe 3 main principle s of IF I treatment : \n1.Su\nrgical debridement of infected tissue;\n2.Minimization of immunosuppression (e.g., avoidance of malnutrition or excessive blood product\ntransfusion) ; and\n3.Utilization of empiric dual antifungal medications (e.g., amphotericin B and a broad -spectrum\ntriazole agent) when there is a strong suspicion of an IFI.9 \nEarly and aggressive \ndebridement of devitalized \ntissue and removal of debris are \nuniversally accepted as the most important interventions . \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 2 \n      \n          \n  \n   \n    \n     \n    \n   \n     \n   \n     \n   \n   \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n      \n   \n \n   \n  \n   \n  \n     \n    \n \n    \n     \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n   \n  \n    Invasive Fungal Infection in War Wounds CPG ID: 28 \nWounds with IFI require a significantly higher number of surgical (not bedside) debridement compared \nto other wound infections. There are also more changes in amputation level (e.g. , revision of a \ntransfemoral amputation to either a hemipelvectomy or hip disarticulation); longer duration following \ninjury to wound closure; and an increased frequency of return to the operating room after wound closure due to infectious complications or drainage.\n12 The role of topical antifungal therapy in the \nprevention of IFI is not clear, but topical therapies have not been demonstrated to have adverse local or systemic effects. \nEVALUATION AND TREATMENT \nThe most important aspect of evaluation and treatment of war wounds is a high index of suspicion for fungal infection, with the early recognition of unhealthy or suspicious wounds followed by early, aggressive, and repetitive surgical debridement of all devitalized tissue and organic material. \nAfter initial debridement, risk factors for invasive fungal infection will be assessed. Identified risk factors \ninclude: \nDismounted blast injury. \nAbove-knee immediate traumatic amputation, or progressive transition from below -knee to \nthrough -knee to above-knee amputation. \nExtensive perineal, genitourinary, and/or rectal inj ury. \nMassive transfusion > 20 units packed red blood cells within 24 hours of injury. \nExtensive deep-partial -thickness or full -thickness burns (note: covered elsewhere).\n17 \nDIAGNOSIS  CRITERIA \nDiagnostic criteria for an IFI are: \n1. Presence of a traumatic wo und(s) . \n2. Recurrent necrosis following at least two consecutive surgical debridements . \n3. Laboratory evidence of fungal infection following at least two surgical debridements (i.e. mold \nculture positivity and/or histopathology indicating tissue invasion).9,15 This is usually not \navailable at deployed Role 2 or Role 3 Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs), so clinical suspicion is key to early intervention. \n4. Fungal wound infection is often manifested by ‘tinctorial’ or color changes in a wound; early detection of such changes requires repeated inspection by an experienced clinician.\n18 \n5. IFIs are often diagnosed through routine histopathological examination of tissue specimens. The evaluation of the performance of periodic acid -Schiff (PAS) and Gomori methenamine sil ver \n(GMS) in combat trauma -associated IFI demonstrated that the two stains were 84% concordant \nwith false negative rates of 44% for PAS and 15% for GMS; however, neither stain was significantly superior at identifying fungal elements. Overall, there is no added benefit for increasing diagnostic yield with use of both stains.\n19 \n6. Where available, pan-fungal PCR, for identification of filamentous fungi evaluation offers \npromise for rapid identification of IFI which can lead to a more timely and accurate diagno sis. \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 3 \n      \n      \n  \n   \n   \n     \n    \n \n    \n     \n  \n     \n   \n    \n  \n   \n     \n \n   \n  \n   \n    \n     \n  \n \n     \n  \n  \n \n   \n    \n     \n    \n     \n   \n  \n   \n  \n      \n   Invasive Fungal Infection in War Wounds CPG ID: 28 \nCompared to histopathology, panfungal PCR was specific (99%), but not as sensitive (63%); \nhowever, sensitivity improved to 83% in specimens from sites with angioinvasion.19 \nTOPICAL TREATMENT \nInitiate topical antifungal therapy on patients with at least three of the above risk factors above in Evaluation and Treatment.\n20,22 There is no clear evidence that any topical treatment improves \noutcomes; however, Dakin’s Solution is commonly used. Dakin’s used an irrigation solution, which is how it was ori ginally described for use, is likely beneficial for severe infections, including fungal \ninfections. Use Dakin’s solution in lieu of saline irrigations for patients meeting criteria.\n23,24 \nIn terms of wound dressings in patients with concern for IFI, nothin g has been definitively proven to \nimprove outcomes, but using a topical antifungal is still conditionally recommended. Options include Dakin’s-soaked Kerlix dressings, Silver Nitrate Solution, or honey\n.20,22- 28 VAC (negative pressure wound \ndressings) are not recommended early in the treatment of IFI, or suspected IFI, because daily trips to the \noperating room are needed for debridement/washout, diagnostics, and source control.  \nUse of Dakin’s solution in the prevention or treatment of IFI, though widespre ad and probably \nsuperior to saline or dry gauze, is unproven. At the US Army Burn Center, a 0.5% aqueous solution of silver nitrate, rather than Dakin’s solution, is the preferred treatment for open wounds at risk of IFI. \nEstablished IFIs may be treated wi th topical Nystatin powder. Topical Silver Nitrate is not always \navailable in the deployed environment.\n29 \nA standardized operative note for wound description is available and should be used throughout the continuum of care for patients at increased risk for IFI. Utilization of this operative note may facilitate the early detection of sequential wound necrosis , which is the crucial first sign of IFI – Appendix B . \nDescription of Bastion Classification of lower limb injuries is presented in Appendix C . Document on the \nfirst page of the Operative Note. \nDEBRIDEMENT  AND  ANTIFUNGAL  THERAPY \n1. For patients transferred to any Role 3 strategic evacuation hub, risk factors for IFI should be \nassessed and ongoing resuscitation requirements should be addressed as needed. The patient should undergo surgical examination, wound washout, and debridement (if indicated) within 6 -\n12 hours of arrival. Dakin ’s wound irrigations  and topical antifungal treatments as described \nabove should be initiated/continued. \n2. Evacuation should be deferred in patients who are clinically unstable and require debridement / wound care every 6-12 hours. Reassess patient to meet evacuation criteria every 24 hours. The \nsurgeon on call should be contacted to evaluate the patient and their wounds immediately on arrival to the next level of care. \n3. Upon arrival to the Role 4 MTF (i.e. regional treatment facility outside of the combat z one, but \nprior to arrival in the United States), the patient should undergo operative exploration, wound washout, and debridement (as indicated) within 6 -12 hours. Obtain histopathology and \nmicrobiology specimens on all patients with at least three risk fa ctors for IFI and any with clinical \nsuspicion. Topical antifungal therapy should be continued. \n4. Upon arrival to an MTF in the United States, the patient should undergo surgical exploration, wound washout, and debridement within 6 -12 hours.

Topical antifungal  dressings may be discontinued at \nany l evel of care when the treating surgeon observes healthy granulation, or when \nhistopathology an d cultures are ne gative for fungal  infection o r colonization. \n5.Follo\nwing the first two debridements in theater, if tissue necrosis is observed in wounds afte r\nt\nwo consecutive debridements, start broad -spectrum antifungal and antibiotic medication s\nim\nmediately and obtain infectious disease consultation. Liposomal amphotericin B is th e\npr\nimary choice due to its effectiveness against mucormycosis, and its reduced potential t o\ni\nnduce nephrotoxicity compared to the non -liposomal formulation.30 Although voriconazole i s\ni\nneffective against mucormycosis, it has shown to be an active agent against molds that ar e\nr\nesistant to amphotericin B (e.g., Aspergillus terreus and Scedosporium prolificans ).31 \n6.I n general, patients with IFI are severely injured, and intravenous formulations of antifunga l\na\ngents are prescribed due to concern for inadequate gastrointestinal antifungal absorption i n\nt\nhe septic patient. As soon as feasible, parameters for monitoring antifungal drug toxiciti es\ns\nhould be implemented (EKG, renal function and LFTs) .\n7.W\nhen voriconazole is administered intravenously, it requires a solubilizing excipient (i.e .\ns\nulfobutyl ether β-cyclodextrin), which may accumulate in patients with impaired renal function .\nA\n black box warning has been issued due to adverse effects of the accumulating solute in a n\na\nnimal model. Nevertheless, the effects of elevated sulfobutyl ether β-cyclodextrin are unknow n\ni\nn humans.32 An IV route of administration of voriconazole did not predict worsening rena l\nd\nysfunction in a small retrospective study with the caveat that only a few patients receive d\nv\noriconazole for ≥ 7 days.33 Clinical experience to date has not shown permanent rena l\ni\nmpairment with this off -label use of voriconazole in the wounded military population.34 \n8.Po saconazole is another triazole agent that has been found to have a 60 -70% response rate as  a\ns\nalvage regimen against mucormycosis when prescribed orally.35-37 Posaconazole tablets ar e\np\nreferred over oral suspension as there is less variability in absorption. Therapeutic dru g\nmo\nnitoring should be used if available to achieve trough concentrations > 1.0 µg/mL.38 \nRecently, an intravenous formulation was approved and has shown to be useful.39 \nThe recommended d ose of p osaconazoIe (tablet f ormulation) i s 300mg by mo uth every 12 hours fo r 2 \ndoses, t hen 3 00mg onc e daily. A posaconazole trough s hould b e obtained on day 7 o f therapy. Note \nthat i f other formulations of posaconazole are used, the dosing will  be different. \nThe typical st arting dose of voriconazoIe i s 6 mg / kg IV every 12 hours for 2 doses, followed by 4 mg/ \nkg (the patient's a ctual  body w eight s hould b e used for d osing). A v oriconazoIe t rough s hould b e \nobtained o n day 4 o f therapy. Goa l trough i s 1 - 1.5 mcg / mL . \n9.D ual administration of liposomal amphotericin B and a broad -spectrum triazole is recommende d\nas t\nhe first -line antifungal agents. Among triazoles, clinical experience has been primarily wit h\nv\noriconazole. Many of the wounds incurred by combat casualties grow more than one mold.32 \nFurthermore, prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics covering both gram- positive and gram-\nnegative organisms (e.g., vancomycin and meropenem)are prescribed as fungal -infecte d\nw\nounds frequently also have bacterial growt h\nIn\nitial studies have shown that combat IFI wound cultures growing order Mucorales will have  a\ns\necond non -Mucorales fungus present 30% of the time.

If long-term treatment is required, the antifungal medications should be targeted based on culture results. \n10. Isavuconazole is a triazole agent available in IV and oral formulations with mold activity including against mucormycosis. Isavuconazole has not been studied in randomized controlled \ntrials but in one multicenter open-label single -arm study, isavuconazole demonstrated similar \nefficacy to amphotericin B formulations in an external matched control group.\n40 \n11. Particular attention should be given to aggressive debridement of non -viable tissue at each \ndebridement proced ure. The extent of necrosis and appearance of the wound before and after \ncompletion of the operation should be documented in the operative note. Appendix B shows a \nstandardized operative note for wound d escription to be used for patients at increased risk for \nIFI. Whenever a significant amount of necrotic tissue is debrided, repeat debridement should be \nperformed in 24 hours or less. \nAs aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic and infected tissue r emains the mainstay of \ntreatment for IFI, surgical exploration and debridement should continue at least every 24 hours \nuntil cessation of necrosis occurs.  Wound coverage and closure should not occur until after the \nwound is clean, contracting, and granula ting. \n12. If angioinvasive fungal elements or fungal elements among tissue are reported on histopathology, or if cultures are positive in the setting of recurrent necrosis, initiate (or continue) treatment with systemic antifungal medications. Treatment will r equire close \nconsultation with infectious disease; however, as a general guideline, stop systemic antifungal \nmedications if the wound remains clean/viable for two weeks and if the patient remains clinically stable. If the patient has a fungal infection in more than one body region (e.g., extremity/pelvis, abdomen, and chest), long-term treatment may be indicated. \nBIOPSY AND TISSUE CULTURE IN OR \nBiopsy should be done at the time of wound exploration (after initial surgical debridement) once the casualty has been evacuated from the theater of conflict (in theater if patient evacuation is delayed) and repeated on subsequent explorations if there are persistent findings (e.g., sepsis physiology, wound \nnecrosis) raising suspicion for IFI. \n1. Tissue samp les should be obtained from each lower extremity in patients with bilateral lower \nextremity amputations. Sample all suspected areas. \n2. Other sites sampled should be at the discretion of the operative surgeon. \n3. At least one specimen should be taken from the ju nction of viable and necrotic tissue (the last \npiece of borderline -viable tissue removed). \n4. For each site sampled, two tissue samples will be collected fresh in two separate sterile \nspecimen containers. \nOne specimen (1 cm3) for “rush” histopathological examination \nOne specimen (1 cm3) for fungal and bacterial culture \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 6 \n      \n     \n  \n   \n   \n   \n  \n   \n  \n  \n     \n     \n    \n  \n \n          \n \n    \n   \n   \n     \n \n \n  \n       \n     \n  \n \n   \n       \n      Invasive Fungal Infection in War Wounds CPG ID: 28 \nOR  STAFF  RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe histopathology specimen is placed in formalin.

Labels contain the following information: \nSite (e.g., left lower extremity) \nPatient’s name, date of birth, and hospital identification number \nDate and time obtained \n“Rush” sticker if available \nInitials of the person labelling the container \n2. Directly contact the on -call pathologist to let them know they will receive a “rush” \nhistopathology specimen for IFI shortly. Deliver the histopathology specimen to the pathology \nlab immediately. \nPATHOLOGY  STAFF  RESPONSIBILITIES \nPathology staff will coordinate processing as rapidly as possible (≤ 24 hours). \n1. Histopathological specimen will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and GMS/PAS stains and evaluated for (1) presence of fungal elements; (2) presence of fungal elements in viable or non-viable tissue; (3) presence of angioinvasion. \n2. Microbiological specimen will be cultured for aerobes, anaerobes, and fungi. \n3. Mycobacterial and/or viral cultures will not be done routinely under this protocol but may be done with special request. \nNOTE: \nFungus can take up to six weeks to grow in culture medium. Therefore, it is recommended that the \ncultures be checked frequently for two weeks; then once a week for four additional weeks before they are considered final.  In addition, wounds without recurre nt tissue necrosis may have mold \ncolonization and not a true infection.\n41 \nTissue preparation for culturing typically destroys the ribbon-like hyphal elements of fungi belonging to the order Mucorales, reducing growth. The microbiology laboratory should be notified that an IFI is \nsuspected so samples are handled appropriately to maximize culture yield. \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 7 \n           \n   \n  \n   \n       \n     \n             \n  \n   \n    \n   \n     \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n  \n \n  \n   \n       \n \n \n     \n \n    \n  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT (PI) MONITORING \nPOPULATION  OF INTEREST \nIdentify patients with IFI \nPatients with 3 or more risk factors for invasive fungal infection (dismounted blast, above knee \namputation, perineal genitourinary or rectal injury, MT> 20 units RBC + WB within 24h of injury.) \nINTENT (EXPECTED OUTCOMES) \nPatients with ≥3 IFI risk factors undergo surgical debridement undergo surgical debridement in \nthe OR within 6 -12 hours of arrival at Role 3 or 4 MTFs. \nPatients with ≥3 IFI risk factors and wounds concerning for IFI are: \ntaken to the OR at least every 24 hours \nare started on IV or PO antifungals. \nAn operative note for wound debridement includes the extent of necrosis quantified as a \npercentage of each wound.  \nPERFORMANCE/ADHERENCE  METRICS \nNumber and percentage of patients in the population of interest who undergo surgical debridement in the OR within 6 -12 hours of arrival at Role 3 or 4 M TFs. \nNumber and percentage of patients in the population of interest who have an operative note that quantifies the extent of wound necrosis as a percentage of each wound. \nDATA  SOURCES \nPatient Record \nDepartment of Defense Trauma Registry (DoDTR) \nSYSTEM REPORTING & FREQUENCY \nThe above constitutes the minimum criteria for PI monitoring of this CPG.

However, under Federal law, in some \ncircumstances, unapproved uses of approved drugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part of clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved uses may also be subject to speci al regulations. \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS \nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. \nFurther, it does not imply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care \npractitioners or considers it to be the “standard of care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is \nto inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for the clinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner- patient relationship. \nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES \nBalanced Discussion \nConsistent with this purpose, CPG dis cussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not \napproved by the FDA. Further, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical \nstudy data, including any such data that suggest caution in the use of the product and specifically \nincluding any FDA -issued warnings. \nQuality Assurance Monitoring \nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance \nmonitoring of outcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of \naccurate clinical records is underscored. \nInformation to Patients \nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing \nan unusual off -label use will address the issue of informa tion to patients. When practicable, \nconsideration will be given to including in an appendix an appropriate information sheet for distribution \nto patients, whether before or after use of the product. Information to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a DoD health care practitioner \nwould decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with such use. \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 17 \n",

There are many clinical and operational limitations to using frozen red cells, but they remain an essential\ncapability . However, whole blood is always preferable to using deglycerolized Red Blood Cells (DRBC).  The idea behind a\nfrozen blood (DRBC) reserve is twofold  in the civilian system : 1.) to freeze units of rare blood types for later use by patients\nwith special transfusion needs and 2.) managing special transfusion circumstances.  For the military, the Navy i s the primary\nuser of DRBC to meet the need s of isolated maritime operational units  with a Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) licensed\nproduct , provide a licensed product when no other option exists, and for contingency reserves. G lycerol is the additive that\nis used to protect the RBCs from the effects of freezing.  When the blood is thawed, the glycerol is removed, and the\nproduct is referred to as DRBC.  The introduction of an automated, functionally closed system for glycerolization and\ndeglycerolization of RBCs improved the operational practice  and decreases the risk of bacterial contamination of the blood .\nThe first operational frozen blood bank was established in 1956 at Chelsea Naval Hospital (Boston), in part to determine the\npracticality of frozen blood usage aboard Navy ships. In 1966, under Department of Defense (DoD) direction, the Navy\nBureau of Medi cine and Surgery established the first frozen blood bank in a combat zone at Nav al Station Hospital, DaNang,\nRepublic of South Vietnam. Over a 7-mon th period, 465 DRBC units were transfused to severely injured casualties. In the\n1980s, the DoD froze 68,000 RBC units. Those units were pre -positioned throughout several geographic Combatant\nCommands in direct support of current and future military medical contingency operations. As of October 2023, just under\n950 units of DRBC have been transfused to under 400 casualties. This compares to over  360,000 units of other blood\nproducts . (Table 1 .)  While DRBC have a role in transfusion therapy, they are less commonly used than other blood products\nand from an operational standpoint, have more of a use on hospital ships and amphibious warships in denied maritime\nenvironments. Navy hospital ships (USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy ) and amphibious war ships routinely deploy with a\nstandard amount frozen blood reserves roughly proportional to casualty holding capacity (Table 2). Aircraft carriers do not\nhave DRBCs, although some have up to 5 units of stored whole blood generated from the ship’s crew. All the ships in tabl e 2\nhave a routine walking blood bank (WBB) capability, but no stored platelets.\nTable 1.

DRBCs can also be made from additive solution Red Blood\nCell ( RBC) units such as CPD/AS -1, CPD/AS- 5 or CP2D/AS -3 if these are first centrifuged to concentrate the RBCs to\nhematocrit of about 75%. The RBCs are stored for up to 6 days at 1 – 6 °C before being frozen in a cryoprotectant (40%\nweight /volume  glycerol) and  stored in the frozen state at minus 65 °C or colder , for up to 10 years. 1\nOnce it is determined that they will be needed for transfusion, the frozen RBCs are thawed. They are then deglycerolized by\nsequential washing with hypertonic (12%) saline followed by normal (0.9%) saline mixed with 0.2% glucose. Following\ndeglycerolization , units  are re -suspended in AS- 3 additive solution and stored at 1 -6°C, until ready for transfusion . DRBC s\nmust recover at least 80% of the RBCs present from the original unit. Units suspended in AS- 3 are FDA- approved for\ntransfusion for up to 14 days when processed on the Haemonetics Automated Cell Processor ACP215  (Figure 1), an FDA\n510(k)-cleared, closed processing system device. DRBCs are licensed under the respective Service Blood Program licenses.1, 2\nAll U.S.  hospital ships and amphibious warships (LHA, LHD, LPD) with DRBC have ACP215.\nTable 2.

The amount of FRBCs and fresh frozen plasma(FFP) may vary depending\non mission requirements.\nFRBC storage and DRBC processing are organic to select naval vess els (Table 2), some garrison medical treatment facilities\n(MTFs), and Service blood depots in the  European Command, Africa Command, and Indo -Pacific Command areas of\nresponsibility . Deployed  MTFs and Medical Detachment Blood Support units do not have the organic mission or capability\nto store and process  frozen RBCs . Use of this capability is based on operational necessity. Upon completion of the\ndeglycerolization process, the produced DRBCs are typically provided to Role 2 and higher MTFs  due to the 14-day shelf life.\nCLINICAL  INDICATIONS   FOR   USE\nEach unit of DRBCs:\n Should be considered equivalent to a fresh unit of RBCs since they are frozen within 6 days of collection , washed\nduring processing, and have a 14- day shelf -life upon deglycerolization.1\n Contains at least  80% of the RBCs present  in the original unit of blood.\n Provides the same physiologic benefits as liquid RBCs.\n Carries the same expectation for post -transfusion survival as liquid -stored RBCs.\n Contains significantly lower concentrations of proteins associated with non -hemolytic transfusion reactions.\n The primary indication for use of frozen and deglycerolized RBCs is as a supplement to LTOWB, fresh whole blood\nand liquid RBCs during surge periods of increased transfusion requirements in order to decrease hemorrhagic\nmorbidity and mortality.\nFrozen and Deglycerolized Red Blood Cells  CPG ID: 26\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 DRBCs may be used in lieu of liquid-s tored RBCs for all RBC transfusion requirements including massive transfusions. The\nJoint Trauma System (JTS) Performance Improvement Branch analyzed data from the DoD Trauma Registry (DoDTR) and\nMassive Transfusion database and found no statistically significant difference in outcomes or transfusion-related\ncomplications between patients who received at least 1 unit of DRBCs as part of their massive transfusion and those  who\nreceived only liquid-stored RBCs (See Appendix A).  A single center prospective randomized trial comparing DRBCs to liquid-\nstored RBCs in stable trauma patients revealed decreased cytokines and D-d imer l evels and increased tissue oxygenation\nmeasured by near infrared spectroscopy i n patients transfused DRBCs. There were no differences in clinical outcomes. 2,4\n Transfusion monitoring:\n C\nlinical: Treat as a routine liquid -stored RBC transfusion before, during, and after transfusion, and for a\nsuspected or actual adverse event.\n Laboratory: Consider obtaining pre- and post -transfusion Hemoglobin /Hematocrit and Base Excess/Deficit or\nlactate levels.\nDOCUMEN TATION\nClinical documentation for a frozen and deglycerolized transfusion is the same as for a liquid transfusion. In addition:\n1. The physician may order use of DRBCs (for example, when washed RBCs would be preferred to reduce risk of\ntransfusion reaction to plasma proteins in some patients), but in practice, the MTF will use DRBCs and liquid- stored\nRBCs interchangeably based on inventories and lo gistical considerations.\n2. The laboratory will establish and maintain a process to document DRBC transfusions in a manner that will facilitate\nfuture evaluation of recipients, including but not limited to:\n Bl ood component identifiers .\n Date of blood component receipt in frozen state .\n Date of thaw/deglycerolization/additive process and resulting expiration date .\n Casualty identifiers  (including nationality and ABO/Rh categorization) .\n Date of transfusion .\n Transfusion indication .\n Transfusion reaction, nature, and outcome .\nOPERATIONAL  CONSIDERATIONS\nThawing and deglycerolization are time -consuming processes  that will keep a well- staffed blood bank completely\nconsumed. Thawing a frozen RBC unit takes about 35 minutes in a plasma thawer and about 45  minutes in a 42°C water\nbath. The process of deglycerolization of one blood unit on an Automated Cell Processor (ACP) -215 takes approximately\none hour, not including time for initial unit thawing and labeling/release of deglycerolized product. When using multiple\nACP215s, maximal throughput from initial thawing to unit release/availability can average up t o 1 U every 2 -3 hours per\ndevice.  A laboratory technician may be trained to operate up to four ACP -215s at once.  However, problems with device\nperformance, supply limitations, breakage of the frozen RBC’s bag during thawing, and technician competency  can lead to\nslower availability times. In periods of predictable operational requirements, it may be advisable to pre -thaw and\ndeglycerolize several units so as not to incur the delay of preparation at the time they are needed.1\nFrozen and Deglycerolized Red Blood Cells  CPG ID: 26\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment   6 Figure 1.  Haemonetics Automated Cell Processor ACP -215 in use.\nPERFORMANCE   IMPROVEMENT   (PI)  MONITORING\nINTENT   (EXPECTED   OUTCOMES)\nAll patients who receive DRBC transfusions have accurate documentation in the medical record of the quantity of\ntransfused blood and any transfusion -related adverse events.\nPERFORMANCE/ADHERENCE  MEASURES\n In patients who were transfused DRBCs, there was accurate documentation, including time of transfusion and all\ntransfused blood products annotated on the blood transfusion form (Appendix B) in the medical record and any\ntransfusion-r elated adverse events.\n Accurate Documentation:\n Document number of units transfused\n Document time of transfusion (on 518 form and i n clinical record)\n Document number of DRBC transfused\n Document transfusion reaction\nDATA   SOURCE\n Patient Record\n DoD T rauma Registry\n Combatant Command blood bank logs\n Theater Medical Data Store  or its successor\nSYSTEM  REPORTING  &  FREQUENCY\nThe above constitutes the minimum criteria for PI monitoring of this CPG. System reporting will be performed twice a year ;\nadditional PI monitoring and system reporting may be performed as needed.\nThe system review and data analysis will be performed by the JTS Chief  and the JTS PI  team .\nFrozen and Deglycerolized Red Blood Cells  CPG ID: 26\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment   7 RESPONSIBILITIES\nIt is the combined responsibility of the trauma team leader and blood bank officer to ensure familiarity, appropriate\ncompliance,  and PI monitoring at the local level with this CPG.\nREFERENCES\n1.

This applies to off-label uses with patients who\nare armed forces members.\nBACKGROUND\nUnapproved (i.e. “off-label”) uses of FDA -approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are usually\nnot subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved\ndrugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part\nof clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved\nuses may also be subject to speci al regulations.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS\nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it does not\nimply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard\nof care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off- label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care\npractitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for the\nclinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship.\nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES\nBalanced Discussion\nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by the FDA.\nFurther, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that sugge st caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA- issued warnings.\nQuality Assurance Monitoring\nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring of\noutcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.\nInformation to Patients\nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an unusual off -\nlabel use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be given to including in an\nappendix  an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product.\nInformation to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a\nDoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with\nsuch use."

The amount of FRBCs and fresh frozen plasma(FFP) may vary depending \non mission requirements.  \nFRBC storage and DRBC processing are organic to select naval vess els (Table 2), some garrison medical treatment facilities \n(MTFs), and Service blood depots in the  European Command, Africa Command, and Indo -Pacific Command areas of \nresponsibility . Deployed  MTFs and Medical Detachment Blood Support units do not have the organic mission or capability \nto store and process  frozen RBCs . Use of this capability is based on operational necessity. Upon completion of the \ndeglycerolization process, the produced DRBCs are typically provided to Role 2 and higher MTFs  due to the 14-day shelf life.  \nCLINICAL  INDICATIONS   FOR   USE   \nEach unit of DRBCs:  \n Should be considered equivalent to a fresh unit of RBCs since they are frozen within 6 days of collection , washed \nduring processing, and have a 14- day shelf -life upon deglycerolization.1 \n Contains at least  80% of the RBCs present  in the original unit of blood.  \n Provides the same physiologic benefits as liquid RBCs.  \n Carries the same expectation for post -transfusion survival as liquid -stored RBCs.  \n Contains significantly lower concentrations of proteins associated with non -hemolytic transfusion reactions.  \n The primary indication for use of frozen and deglycerolized RBCs is as a supplement to LTOWB, fresh whole blood \nand liquid RBCs during surge periods of increased transfusion requirements in order to decrease hemorrhagic \nmorbidity and mortality.  \nFrozen and Deglycerolized Red Blood Cells  CPG ID: 26 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 DRBCs may be used in lieu of liquid-s tored RBCs for all RBC transfusion requirements including massive transfusions. The \nJoint Trauma System (JTS) Performance Improvement Branch analyzed data from the DoD Trauma Registry (DoDTR) and \nMassive Transfusion database and found no statistically significant difference in outcomes or transfusion-related \ncomplications between patients who received at least 1 unit of DRBCs as part of their massive transfusion and those  who \nreceived only liquid-stored RBCs (See Appendix A).  A single center prospective randomized trial comparing DRBCs to liquid-\nstored RBCs in stable trauma patients revealed decreased cytokines and D-d imer l evels and increased tissue oxygenation \nmeasured by near infrared spectroscopy i n patients transfused DRBCs. There were no differences in clinical outcomes. 2,4 \n Transfusion monitoring:\n C\nlinical: Treat as a routine liquid -stored RBC transfusion before, during, and after transfusion, and for a\nsuspected or actual adverse event.\n Laboratory: Consider obtaining pre- and post -transfusion Hemoglobin /Hematocrit and Base Excess/Deficit or\nlactate levels.\nDOCUMEN TATION \nClinical documentation for a frozen and deglycerolized transfusion is the same as for a liquid transfusion. In addition:  \n1. The physician may order use of DRBCs (for example, when washed RBCs would be preferred to reduce risk of\ntransfusion reaction to plasma proteins in some patients), but in practice, the MTF will use DRBCs and liquid- stored\nRBCs interchangeably based on inventories and lo gistical considerations.\n2. The laboratory will establish and maintain a process to document DRBC transfusions in a manner that will facilitate\nfuture evaluation of recipients, including but not limited to:\n Bl ood component identifiers .\n Date of blood component receipt in frozen state .\n Date of thaw/deglycerolization/additive process and resulting expiration date .\n Casualty identifiers  (including nationality and ABO/Rh categorization) .\n Date of transfusion .\n Transfusion indication .\n Transfusion reaction, nature, and outcome .\nOPERATIONAL  CONSIDERATIONS  \nThawing and deglycerolization are time -consuming processes  that will keep a well- staffed blood bank completely \nconsumed. Thawing a frozen RBC unit takes about 35 minutes in a plasma thawer and about 45  minutes in a 42°C water \nbath. The process of deglycerolization of one blood unit on an Automated Cell Processor (ACP) -215 takes approximately \none hour, not including time for initial unit thawing and labeling/release of deglycerolized product. When using multiple \nACP215s, maximal throughput from initial thawing to unit release/availability can average up t o 1 U every 2 -3 hours per \ndevice.  A laboratory technician may be trained to operate up to four ACP -215s at once.  However, problems with device \nperformance, supply limitations, breakage of the frozen RBC’s bag during thawing, and technician competency  can lead to \nslower availability times. In periods of predictable operational requirements, it may be advisable to pre -thaw and \ndeglycerolize several units so as not to incur the delay of preparation at the time they are needed.1\nFrozen and Deglycerolized Red Blood Cells  CPG ID: 26 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment   6 Figure 1.

This applies to off-label uses with patients who \nare armed forces members.   \nBACKGROUND  \nUnapproved (i.e. “off-label”) uses of FDA -approved products are extremely common in American medicine and are usually \nnot subject to any special regulations.  However, under Federal law, in some circumstances, unapproved uses of approved \ndrugs are subject to FDA regulations governing “investigational new drugs.” These circumstances include such uses as part \nof clinical trials, and in the military context, command required, unapproved uses.  Some command requested unapproved \nuses may also be subject to speci al regulations.   \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OFF -LABEL USES IN CPGS \nThe inclusion in CPGs of off -label uses is not a clinical trial, nor is it a command request or requirement. Further, it does not \nimply that the Military Health System requires that use by DoD health care practitioners or considers it to be the “standard \nof care.” Rather, the inclusion in CPGs of off- label uses is to inform the clinical judgment of the responsible health care \npractitioner by providing information regarding potential risks and benefits of treatment alternatives. The decision is for the \nclinical judgment of the responsible health care practitioner within the practitioner -patient relationship. \nADDITIONAL PROCEDURES  \nBalanced Discussion  \nConsistent with this purpose, CPG discussions of off -label uses specifically state that they are uses not approved by the FDA. \nFurther, such discussions are balanced in the presentation of appropriate clinical study data, including any such data that sugge st caution in the use of the product and specifically including any FDA- issued warnings.  \nQuality Assurance Monitoring  \nWith respect to such off -label uses, DoD procedure is to maintain a regular system of quality assurance monitoring of \noutcomes and known potential adverse events.  For this reason, the importance of accurate clinical records is underscored.  \nInformation to Patients  \nGood clinical practice includes the provision of appropriate information to patients.  Each CPG discussing an unusual off -\nlabel use will address the issue of information to patients. When practicable, consideration will be given to including in an  \nappendix  an appropriate information sheet for distribution to patients, whether before or after use of the product. \nInformation to patients should address in plain language: a) that the use is not approved by the FDA; b) the reasons why a \nDoD health care practitioner would decide to use the product for this purpose; and c) the potential risks associated with \nsuch use.  \n",

This is huge undertaking  that requires  a lot of coordination,\ncomm unication,  and iteration. The CPG management team, which includes nurses, physicians and the JTS Chief, will assist\nand be involved with the process. The first author of the CPG will have the biggest responsibility and, along with the JTS\nChief, will be the guarantor of the work. This document on author guidance is meant to serve as a roadmap for first authors\nand the author team. Like all CPGs, it is meant as a guideline, and individual CPGs will vary according to the specific clinical\nproblem they are addressing. JTS CPGs are intended  primarily for the deployed and expeditionary environments, but much\nof the evidence and best practices come from civilian care. JTS CPGs are peer reviewed by a CPG team of physicians.\nRESPONSIBILITIES  FOR  NEW  OR  UPDATED  CPGS\nJTS  RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe following list outlines the responsibilities of  the JTS during the CPG creation process.\n1. Identify and communicate with ﬁrst author and other lead authors. Ensure ﬁrst author has the appropriate\ncredentials to be the lead author. Such credentials include experience with the topic , and ideally operational  and/or\ndeployed experience when appropriate .\n2. Adjudicate  the author list to ensure it represent s the Services.\n3. For CPGs requiring an update, reach out to previous CPG authors and determine whether they desire to lead or\ncontribute to the update.\n4. Gather and invite civilian leaders/authorities on the topic and ensure that they are in communication with the ﬁrst\nauthor and know their responsibility as a Subject Matter Expert (SME).\n5. When appropriate, invite international collaborators and authorities to contribute to the CPG and ensure that the ﬁrst author is in contact with them.\n6. Assign data pulls to data scientists and ensure the data pull is up to date and appropriately address es the clinical\nquestions  of the CPG.\n7. Keep Performance Improvement ( PI), Data Science, Research and Registry Branches all informed on the CPG.\n8. Ensure PI metrics are reviewed by the PI, Registry and Data Science Branches. Determine which PI metrics can be\nautomated from the documentation.\n9. Work closely with the Clinical Forms Work Group to ensure that the relevant clinical elements for the CPG are appropriately captured.\n10. Conduct the  following reviews:\n Final review of CPG\n Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLP -P) review\n Clinical data element review\n PI metric review\n11. Review all the pertinent relevant literature and ensure CPG contains as much recent data as available.\n12. Communicate with Medical Logistics Command (MEDLOG ) on which CPG is being updated and ensure it initiates\nthe creation of the JTS CPG MEDLOG Package.\n13. Generate the infographic for the CPG.\n14. Create Supplemental History and Physical  (H&P ) form  when appropriate.\nCPG Author Guidance  ID:100\n3 LEAD  /  FIRST   AUTHOR   RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe following list outlines the responsibilities of the  lead author or ﬁrst author for a new or updated CPG:\n Unify the product and team  (“herd the cats”).  This is the most challenging responsibility , especially for CPGs with\nmany authors.\n Ensure that each author contributes to the CPG. There are two recommended approaches to this:\n Break the CPG into sections and assign an author (or a team of authors) to draft each section.\n Write the ﬁrst draft of the CPG and send it out to all authors to contribute and edit.\nEither option is acceptable, and the division of the workload is ultimately at the ﬁrst author’s discretion, but all\nauthors must have substantial contribution .\n Be inclusive. Communicate with all authors, the SMEs, and international authors who  were recommended by the\nJTS CPG Branch.\n Ensure all authors contribute to reaching a consensus that the CPG meets academic standards.\n Include the most recent and relevant data. Communicate with the JTS CPG team  to ensure that the most updated\ndata from the Department of Defense Trauma Registry ( DoDTR ) are reviewed.\n Review references and update bibliography. Ensure up to date references are used to update CPG as appropriate.\n If materiel/MEDLOG products are identiﬁed (medications/ventilators/dressings/equipment/devices, etc.), meet\nwith the CPG team  early as possible once JTS has a partnership within  MEDLOG who performs concurrent updates\non the CPG. The authors will have a chance to review and adjudicate the MEDLOG list.\n Remember, a CPG is not a review article. The ﬁrst author should put themselves in the point of view of being a forward deployed caregiver with little experience on the topic the CPG addresses, and that this inexperienced\nprovider has the patient in front of them. Therefore, the CPG should be written in such a way that rapid clinical\nguidance highlighting key, salient, life -saving points can be easily identiﬁed while reviewing the CPG.\nSECTIONS -  GUIDANCE\nRefer to the guidance below for developing  each section of a new or updated CPG.\nNote : Authors should not spend time formatting the CPG! JTS technical writers  are responsible for formatting the CPGs.\nCONTRIBUTOR  LIST\n Please list contributors including rank, name, branch of service and corp. (MC, NC, etc.)\n Ensure first author has appropriate credentials:\n First -hand experience with the topic(s)\n Operational experience, while JTS recognizes that there are some topics that few people will have experience\nwith.\n Ensure ﬁrst author has time/commitment for the CPG\n JTS will manage adjudication of contributor list.\nPREVIOUS  CONTRIBUTORS\n CPG manager will add previous authors .\n Previous authors who are still active duty will have the opportunity to contribute to the CPG update or revision.\n Communication with previous authors will be from JTS CPG team or ﬁrst author.\n Previous authors from the last update will be acknowledged in this section. As the CPG gets updated, this list will\nchange to the penultimate group of authors.\nCPG Author Guidance  ID:100\n4 TABLE  OF  CONTENTS\nNote : This is an example table of contents. The technical writer will format the CPG, including the table of contents which is a\ncustom table of content based on custom style headings.\nExample Table of Contents\nBACKGROUND (hi storical & the need for the CPG)  ................................................................................................... #\nDEFINITIONS  ............. ................................................................................................................................................. #\nDODTR DATA  (Include incidence and epidemiology in military population compare d to civilian relevant data\n[th e overlaps and differences ]); JTS will provide the data  ........................................................................................ #\nCLINICAL SECTIONS: Break CPG into relevant sections (i.e. Evaluation, Treatment ) ................................................ #\nP ERF ORMANCE IMPROVEMENT METRICS ................................................................................................................ #\nPo pulation of Interest  ...................................................................................................................................... #\nIntent (Expected Outcomes)  ........... .................................................................................................................. #\nPerformance Adherance Metrics  ............. ......................................................................................................... #\nREFERENCES  ........... .................................................................................................................................................... #\nADDITIONAL CONSI D ERATIONS  ................................................................................................................................ #\nProlonged Care Considerations  ........... ................................................................................................................ #\nUnique Role 2 o r Role 3 Considerations  ............................................................................................................. #\nPed i atric  Considerations ..................................................................................................................................... #\nAllies & Partner Nations  ....................................................................................................................................... #\nAPPENDI CE S (considerations/topics depend on  CPG)  ……………………………………………………………………………  ..............  #\nPh ysician ’s Order Set  ........................................................................................................................................... #\nSu pplemental H&P F orm ..................................................................................................................................... #\nDO TMLPFP (aspects the CPG addresses)  ............................................................................................................. #\nSUMMARY  OF  CHANGES\nThe Summary of Changes comes right after Table of Contents. The section is helpful for readers familiar with the previous\nCPG version; it provides them with a quick reference for what’s new and improved in this new CPG version.\nList any substantial changes and/or new material to the CPG in this section. Address issues such as:\n Why is the CPG being updated?\n What are the new additions and changes?\n Has the practice changed (i.e. TXA 1 gram vs 2 grams,) or has new information been learned?\nINFOGRAPHIC\nThis is a JTS responsibility and will be developed by the JTS infographic team. Any of the authors who wish to\nassist/contribute to the creation of the CPG Infographic can do so. Contact the JTS CPG team  (POC: Kathy Robbel) to be\nlinked with the infographic team.\nBACKGROUND\nMost CPGs start with a Background and Relevance section. Consider what is the WHY of the CPG  - include both military and\nclinical relevance (or future threat).\n Please include the CPG’s importance to combat casualty care and any changes since the last CPG in this section.  Be\ns\nure ‘The Why’ is clear .\n Review past references from previous versions. Remove old/irrelevant references and add/cite  new or current\nliterature. The references should include operationally/military relevant data. If there are none available, look to\ncivilian sources. Cross reference with national and international guidelines (if available and appropriate).\nCPG Author Guidance  ID:100\n5  Describe current military experience s, scenarios, studies that support the CPG topic.\n Include relevant JTS data if appropriate  (JTS CPG team  will assist and the JTS data scientists will review).\nEVALUATION  AND   TREATMENT\nAdd any other section headings as appropriate for the CPG topic .\nIf this portion of the CPG is substantial and contains multiple paragraphs of considerable length, please add key points in\nbullet format at the beginning of each section under this heading. Determine key points and highlight  any sentences or key\npoints that should be emphasized in the call out boxes or tables. If there are highly important points, communicate with the\nJTS CPG team  to include them  in the Infographic.\nPERFORMANCE   IMPROVEMENT   (PI)   MONITORING\nPlease use current PI metrics in the CPG and highlight anything that should be added , updated,  or removed . Please ensure\nthat the metrics enumerated in this section are addressed/mentioned/explained in the body of the CPG as appropriate.\nThe PI metrics play a crucial role in each CPG and should be carefully considered. If something is a PI metric,  then it will be\ntracked by not only the JTS PI team, but also in the DoDTR.  So, for example if the CPG states: “ it is crucial to receive\n_______therapy within ______amount of ti me,” then both the PI team (for compliance/variance reports) and the Do DTR\nteam will need to track that metric. There should be no less than two and no more than 10 CPG compliance metrics .\nREFERENCES\nConduct an updated literature review to determine if any new data has been published on the CPG topic and update\nall references accordingly.\nDOTMLPF -P  CONSIDERATIONS   (IF  APPROPRIATE)\nThis section has been added to all new and updated CPGs to ensure the JTS CPGs can be used as a guide for\nleaders /commanders so that clinical care in the operational environment has the appropriate attention and gaps are\nidentiﬁed. This section is primarily for commanders, including non- medical commanders. It is to support medical units\nand can be used as a communica tion tool to list the resources needed to care for the patient addressed by the CPG.\nThis section will not address clinical care, but rather t he needs of the unit in order to perform the clinical care\ndescribed in the CPG.\nDOTMLPF -P is a tool which  allows leaders to analyze organizational capabilities from the perspective of “Doctrine,\nOrganization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy” when making decisions and resource\ndeterminations. This section is meant as a communi cation tool for teams , units,  and command surgeons to ground\nmedical units, clinical care,  and clinical standards in an operational framework. This will be challenging and require\nthought. N ot every domain element will be relevant for a CPG and may be left blank. This framework as a CPG\nappendix is to initiate administrative , training , personnel, material,  and acquisition eﬀorts to support best practices for\nthe speciﬁc combat casualty clinical scenario addressed in the CPG. DOPTMLPF- P is mission focused , whereas the\nmission of the CPG is to address the clinical needs of the combat casualty. This section is meant to support what is\nnecessary and drive any changes for gaps that are identiﬁed in the clinical care that the CPG addresses.\nIn summary, this section is meant to deﬁne a ‘capability need’ or the ‘capability gap’ to accomplish the mission, which is the care of the casualty, and identify the needed capabilities to treat the casualty according to the clinical guidance described in the CPG.\nSee the DOTMF- P components descriptions on the next page.\nJTS CPG Author Guidance  ID:100\n6 DOTMLPF -P COMPONENTS\nDoctrine  – The way things are done/the way the mission is achieved. ‘The way\nwe have always done it.’ Is there existing doctrine that supports this CPG? Most\nCPGs will not have a doctrine element . In this column place any doctrinal\nrequirements for the CPG. What\nneeds to be indoctrinated to use the\nCPG to improve the care of combat\ncasualties.\nOrganization  – How teams/units are organized to achieve the mission. This is\nrelevant given that some deployed medical teams will not be able to care for\ncertain casualties, emphasizing the need for early transport. For example, if a\nteam does not have a surgical capability, but the CPG mainly\naddresses/emphasizes surgical treatment. It is deﬁned as ‘how military units\norganize to ﬁght  (e.g., divisions, air wings, Marine -Air Ground Task Forces).\nCombat casualty care (CCC) capabilities are organized by Role 1, 2, 3, 4. How\ndoes the CPG ﬁt into the deployed continuum of car e? Is it a Role 2/3 CPG?\nWhat are the prehospital implications ? Where on the CCC continuum does the\nCPG get implemented? For example, the Traumatic Brain Injury and\nNeurosurgery CPG is a Role 3 CPG, with some Role 2 and prehospital\nconsiderations.  In this column place organizational\nrequirement to execute the clinical\ncare recommended in the CPG. Does\nthere need to be an OR?  A Blood\nBank?  See description.\nTraining  – Most CPGs will have training implications. They should be listed here.\nNot all training will be a requirement, but if there is required training for the clinical entity that the CPG is addressing, it should be explained. This can be\nused to drive pre -deployment training requirements. It is deﬁned as how units\nprepare to ﬁght tactically (from basic training to advanced individual training, unit training, joint exercises, etc.). If training exercises should include what is\nbeing addressed in the CPG, mention it here (the Walking Blood Bank (WBB) is\nanother example). This should drive elements of a joint curriculum based on battleﬁeld care . In this column place the training\nimplications and training\nrequirement s to execute the mission\noutlined in the CPG.  Is the training just CPG training or are there\nrequirements that should be executed in the MHS?\nMateriel  – The JTS has a partnership with MEDLOG , who will assist with this\nsection. MEDLOG is reviewing each CPG for the materiel requirements necessary to care for the patient addressed by the CPG. The lead author will get\nthe list from MEDLOG and work with the CPG team  and MEDLOG for updates.\nMost CPGs do have a materiel requirement (medications, devices, dressings, equipment, etc.). It is deﬁned as all the “stuﬀ” necessary to equip our forces\n(medical units/teams) that DOES NOT require a new developme nt eﬀort (it is\nwhat is available “oﬀ the shelf” both commercially and within the government).  This column could get unruly. In this\ncolumn list the materiel requirements needed to execute the CPG. This will be mostly medication and stuﬀ.\nLeadership and Education  – This is deﬁned as : “how we prepare our leaders to\nlead the ﬁght, from squad leader to 4- star general/admiral to professional\ndevelopment. ” Most of the JTS CPGS have some sort of educational component\nthat should be delineated here. This links closely to training but is diﬀerent. For example, the Emergency Life -Saving Cranial Procedures by Non- Neurosurgeons\nin the Deployed Setting CPG states  that general surgeons should scrub on\ncraniotomies prior to deploying if there is a possibility of perform ing this\nprocedure at the Role 2. One of the leadership criteria is the Role 1- 3\ncommanders should be familiar with the CPG so the unit can perform/manage the clinical entity the CPG is addressing. Another example is for the Dismounted\nComplex Blast Injury  (DCBI)  CPG. Leaders should be aware of this risk of DCBI\nand ensure teams are educated and trained on the unique aspects of\nmanagement of these casualties and that there are always enough blood In this column put the leadership\nqualities and support that is needed\nto manage the type of patients being discussed in the CPG.\nCPG Author Guidance  ID:100\n7 DOTMLPF -P COMPONENTS\nproducts available (or WBB prescreened and trained) should the unit encounter\nservice members with DCBI.\nPersonnel  – This is deﬁned as: “the availability of qualiﬁed people for\npeacetime, wartime, and various contingency operations. ” Does the CPG require\nspecialized care? Urologic injuries, neurosurgeons, radiologists? Who are the\nqualiﬁed personnel necessary to care for the casualty the CPG addresses ? In this column state  any necessary\npersonnel to execute what you have written in the CPG  (i.e.  trained\nnurses, lab tech, radiology techs )\nFacilities  – This is deﬁned as: “real property; land, buildings, installations, and\nindustrial facilities ( i.e. government owned ammunition production facilities)\nthat support the forces  – the property / buildings/ facilities needed to do the\nmission. ”  Most CPGs will not have this requirement. The Frozen Red Blood Cells\nCPG requires facilities that can deglycerize blood. For the JTS CPGs, since the\nbattlespace is dynamic, ﬁxed facilities are not really ever required; however,\nelements of facilities may be necessary. E xamples: facility can support a\ntemperature regulated operating room; a facility that can support instrument\nsterilization; facility that has a covered area required for triage, etc. Most CPGs\nwill not link to a facility requirement but characterize aspects needed in\nbuildings, tents, and deployed military medical treatment facilities that will help\nmedical units communicate these needs with base/deployed installation leadership.  In this column list any facility\nrequirements to be able to implement the care discussed in the CPG.\nExamples:  ORs, Burn ORs, pathology\nlab, instrument throughput .\nPolicy  – The best example of this is the Golden Hour  (GH)  Policy that was signed\nby Sec Def Gates in 2009. Most CPGs will not impact all military policy – but\nthere might be medical policies which  should be considered. It is deﬁned as:\n“any DoD, interagency, or foreign policy which aﬀects the other seven\n(DOTMLPF) elements. ” The GH policy had impacts across the entire battleﬁeld\nfrom doctrine, organization, person, etc. The WBB has also impacted policy with\nthe WBB -Donor Screening Department of Defense Instruction and driven\nrequirements for units to get prescreened prior to deployment.

If the CPG is verbose , move extra information to the appendix . See First\nAuthor Responsibilities #8. The appendix section can contain extra background and information that is academically relevant\nbut not needed to immediately care for the casualty. Appendices can be used liberally (for example, Burn Care CPG ID: 12) to add information that does not need to be in the ‘guidance body’ of the CPG.\nCPG Author Guidance  ID:100\n8 NOTES  TO  THE   AUTHORS\n Allow 2-4 weeks to review the CPG and then schedule a meeting with the adjudication team to review an outline of\nrecommended changes. This will assist in improving team eﬃciency and cover expectations from both parties.\n Data requests can be collected at this time to expedite the process.\n If pictures, graphs, etc. are added, please cite the source and send the original .\n Please do not waste time formatting as the technical writer team will format the CPG.\n Timeframe : We strive to publish CPGs on the JTS website  and JTS Deployed website within 4- 6 months from the\ntime the author team is assembled."

This is huge undertaking  that requires  a lot of coordination, \ncomm unication,  and iteration. The CPG management team, which includes nurses, physicians and the JTS Chief, will assist  \nand be involved with the process. The first author of the CPG will have the biggest responsibility and, along with the JTS \nChief, will be the guarantor of the work. This document on author guidance is meant to serve as a roadmap for first authors \nand the author team. Like all CPGs, it is meant as a guideline, and individual CPGs will vary according to the specific clinical \nproblem they are addressing. JTS CPGs are intended  primarily for the deployed and expeditionary environments, but much \nof the evidence and best practices come from civilian care. JTS CPGs are peer reviewed by a CPG team of physicians.  \nRESPONSIBILITIES  FOR  NEW  OR  UPDATED  CPGS  \nJTS  RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe following list outlines the responsibilities of  the JTS during the CPG creation process.  \n1. Identify and communicate with ﬁrst author and other lead authors. Ensure ﬁrst author has the appropriate \ncredentials to be the lead author. Such credentials include experience with the topic , and ideally operational  and/or \ndeployed experience when appropriate . \n2. Adjudicate  the author list to ensure it represent s the Services. \n3. For CPGs requiring an update, reach out to previous CPG authors and determine whether they desire to lead or \ncontribute to the update.  \n4. Gather and invite civilian leaders/authorities on the topic and ensure that they are in communication with the ﬁrst \nauthor and know their responsibility as a Subject Matter Expert (SME).  \n5. When appropriate, invite international collaborators and authorities to contribute to the CPG and ensure that the ﬁrst author is in contact with them.  \n6. Assign data pulls to data scientists and ensure the data pull is up to date and appropriately address es the clinical \nquestions  of the CPG.  \n7. Keep Performance Improvement ( PI), Data Science, Research and Registry Branches all informed on the CPG.  \n8. Ensure PI metrics are reviewed by the PI, Registry and Data Science Branches. Determine which PI metrics can be \nautomated from the documentation.  \n9. Work closely with the Clinical Forms Work Group to ensure that the relevant clinical elements for the CPG are appropriately captured.  \n10. Conduct the  following reviews:  \n Final review of CPG \n Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLP -P) review  \n Clinical data element review  \n PI metric review \n11. Review all the pertinent relevant literature and ensure CPG contains as much recent data as available.  \n12. Communicate with Medical Logistics Command (MEDLOG ) on which CPG is being updated and ensure it initiates \nthe creation of the JTS CPG MEDLOG Package.  \n13. Generate the infographic for the CPG.  \n14. Create Supplemental History and Physical  (H&P ) form  when appropriate.  \n \nCPG Author Guidance  ID:100  \n3 LEAD  /  FIRST   AUTHOR   RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe following list outlines the responsibilities of the  lead author or ﬁrst author for a new or updated CPG:  \n Unify the product and team  (“herd the cats”).  This is the most challenging responsibility , especially for CPGs with \nmany authors.  \n Ensure that each author contributes to the CPG. There are two recommended approaches to this:   \n Break the CPG into sections and assign an author (or a team of authors) to draft each section.  \n Write the ﬁrst draft of the CPG and send it out to all authors to contribute and edit.  \nEither option is acceptable, and the division of the workload is ultimately at the ﬁrst author’s discretion, but all \nauthors must have substantial contribution . \n Be inclusive. Communicate with all authors, the SMEs, and international authors who  were recommended by the \nJTS CPG Branch.  \n Ensure all authors contribute to reaching a consensus that the CPG meets academic standards.  \n Include the most recent and relevant data. Communicate with the JTS CPG team  to ensure that the most updated \ndata from the Department of Defense Trauma Registry ( DoDTR ) are reviewed.  \n Review references and update bibliography. Ensure up to date references are used to update CPG as appropriate.  \n If materiel/MEDLOG products are identiﬁed (medications/ventilators/dressings/equipment/devices, etc.), meet \nwith the CPG team  early as possible once JTS has a partnership within  MEDLOG who performs concurrent updates \non the CPG. The authors will have a chance to review and adjudicate the MEDLOG list.  \n Remember, a CPG is not a review article. The ﬁrst author should put themselves in the point of view of being a forward deployed caregiver with little experience on the topic the CPG addresses, and that this inexperienced \nprovider has the patient in front of them. Therefore, the CPG should be written in such a way that rapid clinical \nguidance highlighting key, salient, life -saving points can be easily identiﬁed while reviewing the CPG.  \nSECTIONS -  GUIDANCE  \nRefer to the guidance below for developing  each section of a new or updated CPG.  \nNote : Authors should not spend time formatting the CPG! JTS technical writers  are responsible for formatting the CPGs.  \nCONTRIBUTOR  LIST  \n Please list contributors including rank, name, branch of service and corp. (MC, NC, etc.)  \n Ensure first author has appropriate credentials:  \n First -hand experience with the topic(s)  \n Operational experience, while JTS recognizes that there are some topics that few people will have experience \nwith.  \n Ensure ﬁrst author has time/commitment for the CPG  \n JTS will manage adjudication of contributor list.  \nPREVIOUS  CONTRIBUTORS  \n CPG manager will add previous authors .  \n Previous authors who are still active duty will have the opportunity to contribute to the CPG update or revision.  \n Communication with previous authors will be from JTS CPG team or ﬁrst author.  \n Previous authors from the last update will be acknowledged in this section. As the CPG gets updated, this list will \nchange to the penultimate group of authors.  \nCPG Author Guidance  ID:100  \n4 TABLE  OF  CONTENTS  \nNote : This is an example table of contents. The technical writer will format the CPG, including the table of contents which is a \ncustom table of content based on custom style headings.  \nExample Table of Contents  \n BACKGROUND (hi storical & the need for the CPG)  ................................................................................................... #  \n DEFINITIONS  ............. ................................................................................................................................................. #  \n DODTR DATA  (Include incidence and epidemiology in military population compare d to civilian relevant data \n [th e overlaps and differences ]); JTS will provide the data  ........................................................................................ #  \n CLINICAL SECTIONS: Break CPG into relevant sections (i.e. Evaluation, Treatment ) ................................................ #  \n P ERF ORMANCE IMPROVEMENT METRICS ................................................................................................................ #  \n Po pulation of Interest  ...................................................................................................................................... # \n Intent (Expected Outcomes)  ........... .................................................................................................................. # \n Performance Adherance Metrics  ............. ......................................................................................................... #  \n REFERENCES  ........... .................................................................................................................................................... #  \n ADDITIONAL CONSI D ERATIONS  ................................................................................................................................ #  \n Prolonged Care Considerations  ........... ................................................................................................................ # \n Unique Role 2 o r Role 3 Considerations  ............................................................................................................. # \n Ped i atric  Considerations ..................................................................................................................................... # \n Allies & Partner Nations  ....................................................................................................................................... # \n APPENDI CE S (considerations/topics depend on  CPG)  ……………………………………………………………………………  ..............  # \n Ph ysician ’s Order Set  ........................................................................................................................................... # \n Su pplemental H&P F orm ..................................................................................................................................... # \n DO TMLPFP (aspects the CPG addresses)  ............................................................................................................. # \nSUMMARY  OF  CHANGES  \nThe Summary of Changes comes right after Table of Contents. The section is helpful for readers familiar with the previous \nCPG version; it provides them with a quick reference for what’s new and improved in this new CPG version.  \nList any substantial changes and/or new material to the CPG in this section. Address issues such as:  \n Why is the CPG being updated?\n What are the new additions and changes?\n Has the practice changed (i.e. TXA 1 gram vs 2 grams,) or has new information been learned?\nINFOGRAPHIC \nThis is a JTS responsibility and will be developed by the JTS infographic team. Any of the authors who wish to \nassist/contribute to the creation of the CPG Infographic can do so. Contact the JTS CPG team  (POC: Kathy Robbel) to be \nlinked with the infographic team.  \nBACKGROUND  \nMost CPGs start with a Background and Relevance section. Consider what is the WHY of the CPG  - include both military and \nclinical relevance (or future threat).   \n Please include the CPG’s importance to combat casualty care and any changes since the last CPG in this section.  Be\ns\nure ‘The Why’ is clear .\n Review past references from previous versions. Remove old/irrelevant references and add/cite  new or current\nliterature. The references should include operationally/military relevant data. If there are none available, look to\ncivilian sources. Cross reference with national and international guidelines (if available and appropriate).\nCPG Author Guidance  ID:100  \n5  Describe current military experience s, scenarios, studies that support the CPG topic.  \n Include relevant JTS data if appropriate  (JTS CPG team  will assist and the JTS data scientists will review).  \nEVALUATION  AND   TREATMENT  \nAdd any other section headings as appropriate for the CPG topic . \nIf this portion of the CPG is substantial and contains multiple paragraphs of considerable length, please add key points in \nbullet format at the beginning of each section under this heading. Determine key points and highlight  any sentences or key \npoints that should be emphasized in the call out boxes or tables. If there are highly important points, communicate with the \nJTS CPG team  to include them  in the Infographic.  \nPERFORMANCE   IMPROVEMENT   (PI)   MONITORING  \nPlease use current PI metrics in the CPG and highlight anything that should be added , updated,  or removed . Please ensure \nthat the metrics enumerated in this section are addressed/mentioned/explained in the body of the CPG as appropriate.  \nThe PI metrics play a crucial role in each CPG and should be carefully considered. If something is a PI metric,  then it will be \ntracked by not only the JTS PI team, but also in the DoDTR.  So, for example if the CPG states: “ it is crucial to receive \n_______therapy within ______amount of ti me,” then both the PI team (for compliance/variance reports) and the Do DTR \nteam will need to track that metric. There should be no less than two and no more than 10 CPG compliance metrics . \nREFERENCES  \nConduct an updated literature review to determine if any new data has been published on the CPG topic and update \nall references accordingly.  \nDOTMLPF -P  CONSIDERATIONS   (IF  APPROPRIATE)  \nThis section has been added to all new and updated CPGs to ensure the JTS CPGs can be used as a guide for \nleaders /commanders so that clinical care in the operational environment has the appropriate attention and gaps are \nidentiﬁed. This section is primarily for commanders, including non- medical commanders. It is to support medical units \nand can be used as a communica tion tool to list the resources needed to care for the patient addressed by the CPG. \nThis section will not address clinical care, but rather t he needs of the unit in order to perform the clinical care \ndescribed in the CPG.  \nDOTMLPF -P is a tool which  allows leaders to analyze organizational capabilities from the perspective of “Doctrine, \nOrganization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy” when making decisions and resource \ndeterminations. This section is meant as a communi cation tool for teams , units,  and command surgeons to ground \nmedical units, clinical care,  and clinical standards in an operational framework. This will be challenging and require \nthought. N ot every domain element will be relevant for a CPG and may be left blank.

The JTS adjudication team will cross reference with \ndocumentation tools (forms, EHRs, etc.) and assemble a form, if appropriate.  \nAPPENDI CES  (AS  NEEDED)  \nInclude updated forms if they have changed. If the CPG is verbose , move extra information to the appendix . See First \nAuthor Responsibilities #8. The appendix section can contain extra background and information that is academically relevant \nbut not needed to immediately care for the casualty. Appendices can be used liberally (for example, Burn Care CPG ID: 12) to add information that does not need to be in the ‘guidance body’ of the CPG.  \n \nCPG Author Guidance  ID:100  \n8 NOTES  TO  THE   AUTHORS  \n Allow 2-4 weeks to review the CPG and then schedule a meeting with the adjudication team to review an outline of \nrecommended changes. This will assist in improving team eﬃciency and cover expectations from both parties.  \n Data requests can be collected at this time to expedite the process.  \n If pictures, graphs, etc. are added, please cite the source and send the original .  \n Please do not waste time formatting as the technical writer team will format the CPG.  \n Timeframe : We strive to publish CPGs on the JTS website  and JTS Deployed website within 4- 6 months from the \ntime the author team is assembled.  \n",

Understanding normal physiological parameters is essential for identifying abnormal clinical status in\nan MWD and assessing response to treatment.\nUnique clinical anatomy of MWDs must also be understood to perform medical interventions and to monitor changes in\nphysiologic status. MWDs will also traumatize medical devices and require additional interventions to maintain MWD safety.\nNORMAL  CLINICAL  PARAMETERS\nTable 1.

Knowledge of these diﬀerences will\nassist providers when managing MWDs.\nMost MWDs are German Shepherd Dogs, Belgian Malinois and Labrador Retrievers, with a weight of 50 to 80 pounds\n(23 – 36 kilograms). Dose drugs based on actual body weight whenever possible.\nVENOUS  BLOOD   SAMPLING   &   IV  CATHETERIZATION  SITES\nUse the cephalic or lateral saphenous vein for routine blood sampling, drug administration, and routine intravenous (IV)\nﬂuid therapy. Use the external jugular vein for long- term IV ﬂuid therapy, large volume ﬂuid delivery, and repeated blood\nsampling.\nCephalic  Vein\nFigure 1 shows the location of the cephalic vein on the cranial (anterior) forearm. The accessory cephalic vein and cephalic\nvein join in a Y -shaped conﬁguration distal (toward the carpus or wrist). Figure 2 shows proper technique for occlusion of\nthe cep halic vein. An assistant will occlude the vein by extending the elbow joint and occluding the vein while rolling the\nvein outward at the elbow. Figure 3 shows proper location of an IV catheter in the cephalic vein.\nNormal Clinical Parameters in MWDs CPG ID: 02\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  4 Figure 1.  Cephalic vein location\nFigure 2.  Occlusion of cephalic vein\nFigure 3.  Cephalic IV catheter placement\nLateral   Saphenous  Vein\nFigure 4 shows the location of the lateral saphenous vein on the lateral aspect of the hind limb at the distal tibial area,\ncoursing caudally and proximally from the hock (ankle) and over the gastrocnemius tendon.\nNormal Clinical Parameters in MWDs CPG ID: 02\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  5 Figure 4.  Lateral saphenous vein location\nExternal   Jugular   Vein\nTo access the external jugular vein, standard human central venous catheter kits can be used; the Seldinger technique is\nmost reliable.\nThe external jugular vein is in the jugular furrow (Figure 5) and is punctured distal to the junction of the proximal tributa ries.\nClip the hair and perform a sterile preparation (including draping). Create a small skin nick using a #11 scalpel blade or an\n18-gauge needle over the intended catheter insertion site to facilitate skin penetration (Figure 6).\nA large bore over -the-needle catheter is inserted through the skin and directed caudally into the external jugular vein\n(Figure 7). The opposite hand can be used to occlude the vein. Following full insertion of the over -the-needle catheter\n(Figure 8), a Seldinger guide wire is inserted into the hub of the catheter (Figure 9 ).\nThe guide wire is advanced about two -thirds of the way, and then the catheter is removed, leaving the guidewire in place\n(Figure 10 ). It is essential to maintain control of the guidewire. A single or multi -lumen central venous catheter is advanced\nover the guidewire ( Figure 11 ). Use of a dilator is often necessary before this step to enlarge the puncture in the skin and\nvessel to accommodate the catheter diameter.\nThe catheter is advanced into the external jugular vein (Figure 12 ). The guidewire should extend from the proximal end of\nthe catheter. Remember to always maintain control of the guidewire. Once the catheter is fully inserted, the guidewire is\nremoved, and an injection port is attached to the catheter hub ( Figure 13 ).\nSecure the catheter to the MWD’s skin with suture through the wings of the catheter hub, and circumferentially around the\ncatheter base ( Figure 14 ). The central venous catheter should then be secured on the MWD’s neck with roll gauze or cast\npadding ( Figure 15 ) followed by non- adherent bandage material (Figure 16 ). At least two ﬁngers should be able to be placed\nunder the bandage to ensure it is not too tight. Always monitor the MWD for any signs of facial swelling or respiratory\ndistress caused by the bandage being too tight.\nNormal Clinical Parameters in MWDs CPG ID: 02\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 Figure 5.

Securing central venous catheter with roll gauze\nor cast padding.\nFigure 16.  Complete securement of central venous\ncatheter with bandage material.\nROUTINE  CARDIOVASCULAR  MONITORING\nHeart sounds are best auscultated over the left lower lateral thoracic wall between the 4th and 5th intercostal spaces,\ntypically where the elbow crosses the chest wall when the forelimb is pulled caudally.\nThe arterial pulse is best palpated at the femoral artery on the medial aspect of the proximal thigh in the inguinal area\n(Figure 17 and 18). The arterial pulse can also be palpated at the dorsal metatarsal artery on the dorso -medial aspect of the\nproximal hind paw, distal to the hock (ankle).\nFigure 17.  Location for palpation of the femoral arterial\npulse while dog is standing.\nFigure 18.  Location for palpation of the femoral\narterial pulse from medial view of the hind limb.\nELECTROCARDIOGRAMS\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes should be taped to the pads of the paws (Figure 19 below ) on the left forelimb (black\nlead), right forelimb (white lead), and left hind limb (red lead). Three -lead ECGs are suﬃcient. Canine ECG complexes\nresemble human complexes, with minor variations in key ECG intervals and possible inverted T -waves. Electrode or\nultrasound gel may be required between the electrode and footpads to improve contact.\nNormal Clinical Parameters in MWDs CPG ID: 02\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9\nFigure 19.  Placement of ECG electrode pads.\nPULSE   OXIMETRY\nHuman pulse oximetry probes (typically ﬁnger probes) are best placed on the tongue for optimal reliability in unconscious,\nsedated or anesthetized MWDs (Figure 20) but can also be placed on the prepuce or vulva. In conscious dogs, use the ear\npinna, lip fold, or ﬂank skin fold. Although these are not optimal for pulse oximetry, these alternate sites generally yie ld\nreliable results. Normal pulse oximetry for an MWD is greater than 95%.\nFigure 20.  Placement of human pulse oximeter ﬁnger probe on tongue.\nNON -INVASIVE  BLOOD  PRESSURE   MONITORING\nNon -invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring is accomplished with doppler or oscillometric techniques. Cuﬀ size and\npatient positioning are critical to obtain accurate readings. The width of the cuﬀ should be 30 - 40% of the limb\ncircumference at the si te of cuﬀ placement.4 Human pediatric cuﬀs (size 6 to 8) ﬁt most MWDs.\nCommon locations for doppler probe placement include the dorsal pedal artery, digital artery, and coccygeal artery\n(Figure 21  below ). Patients should lie in lateral recumbency with the cuﬀ positioned on the limb at the level of the right\natrium.\nCommon locations for cuﬀ placement for oscillometric measurements are over the dorsal metatarsal artery, lower forearm,\nand tail base.\nNormal Clinical Parameters in MWDs CPG ID: 02\nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  10 Figure 21.  Placement of doppler probe on digital artery with accompanying cuﬀ placement.\nPREVENTION  OF  SELF -TRAUMA  &   REMOVAL  OF  DEVICES\nMWDs will chew at catheters, bandages and monitoring devices. They will lick and chew at wounds to the point of causing\nforeign body ingestion and self -trauma. Use basket muzzles in the immediate period of initial monitoring and care to\nprevent these unwan ted behaviors.\nTape IV catheters around the entire circumference of the limb, including the hub and catheter adapter port to adequately\nsecure the catheter. The tape should be snug but use caution to prevent excessive tightness that will result in distal limb\nedema. Monitor the MWD regularly and loosen the catheter tape if swelling or edema is noted.\nFor long -term management, an Elizabethan collar (e- collar) should be used. If the MWD quickly damages a standard e -collar,\nanother simple option is to make a preventive device. The bottom of a standard bucket is removed, 4 to 5 holes are drilled in\nthe bas e of the bucket, and cable ties are used through the holes to secure the bucket to the dog’s collar. The bucket -collar\ncombination is then applied. Figures 22 and 23 show the bucket technique and the appearance after application to the\nMWD.\nFigure 22.  Technique to make a bucket to prevent self -\ntrauma by MWDs.\nFigure 23.

It is essential to maintain control of the guidewire. A single or multi -lumen central venous catheter is advanced \nover the guidewire ( Figure 11 ). Use of a dilator is often necessary before this step to enlarge the puncture in the skin and \nvessel to accommodate the catheter diameter.  \nThe catheter is advanced into the external jugular vein (Figure 12 ). The guidewire should extend from the proximal end of \nthe catheter. Remember to always maintain control of the guidewire. Once the catheter is fully inserted, the guidewire is \nremoved, and an injection port is attached to the catheter hub ( Figure 13 ).  \nSecure the catheter to the MWD’s skin with suture through the wings of the catheter hub, and circumferentially around the \ncatheter base ( Figure 14 ). The central venous catheter should then be secured on the MWD’s neck with roll gauze or cast \npadding ( Figure 15 ) followed by non- adherent bandage material (Figure 16 ). At least two ﬁngers should be able to be placed \nunder the bandage to ensure it is not too tight. Always monitor the MWD for any signs of facial swelling or respiratory \ndistress caused by the bandage being too tight.  \n\nNormal Clinical Parameters in MWDs CPG ID: 02  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  6 Figure 5.

The arterial pulse can also be palpated at the dorsal metatarsal artery on the dorso -medial aspect of the \nproximal hind paw, distal to the hock (ankle).  \nFigure 17.  Location for palpation of the femoral arterial \npulse while dog is standing.  \n Figure 18.  Location for palpation of the femoral \narterial pulse from medial view of the hind limb.  \nELECTROCARDIOGRAMS  \nElectrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes should be taped to the pads of the paws (Figure 19 below ) on the left forelimb (black \nlead), right forelimb (white lead), and left hind limb (red lead). Three -lead ECGs are suﬃcient. Canine ECG complexes \nresemble human complexes, with minor variations in key ECG intervals and possible inverted T -waves. Electrode or \nultrasound gel may be required between the electrode and footpads to improve contact.  \n \n\nNormal Clinical Parameters in MWDs CPG ID: 02  \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  9  \nFigure 19.  Placement of ECG electrode pads.  \n \nPULSE   OXIMETRY  \nHuman pulse oximetry probes (typically ﬁnger probes) are best placed on the tongue for optimal reliability in unconscious, \nsedated or anesthetized MWDs (Figure 20) but can also be placed on the prepuce or vulva. In conscious dogs, use the ear \npinna, lip fold, or ﬂank skin fold. Although these are not optimal for pulse oximetry, these alternate sites generally yie ld \nreliable results. Normal pulse oximetry for an MWD is greater than 95%.  \nFigure 20.  Placement of human pulse oximeter ﬁnger probe on tongue.  \n \nNON -INVASIVE  BLOOD  PRESSURE   MONITORING  \nNon -invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring is accomplished with doppler or oscillometric techniques. Cuﬀ size and \npatient positioning are critical to obtain accurate readings. The width of the cuﬀ should be 30 - 40% of the limb \ncircumference at the si te of cuﬀ placement.4 Human pediatric cuﬀs (size 6 to 8) ﬁt most MWDs.  \nCommon locations for doppler probe placement include the dorsal pedal artery, digital artery, and coccygeal artery  \n(Figure 21  below ). Patients should lie in lateral recumbency with the cuﬀ positioned on the limb at the level of the right \natrium.  \nCommon locations for cuﬀ placement for oscillometric measurements are over the dorsal metatarsal artery, lower forearm, \nand tail base.  \n\nNormal Clinical Parameters in MWDs CPG ID: 02 \nGuideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment  10 Figure 21.  Placement of doppler probe on digital artery with accompanying cuﬀ placement.  \nPREVENTION  OF  SELF -TRAUMA  &   REMOVAL  OF  DEVICES  \nMWDs will chew at catheters, bandages and monitoring devices. They will lick and chew at wounds to the point of causing \nforeign body ingestion and self -trauma. Use basket muzzles in the immediate period of initial monitoring and care to \nprevent these unwan ted behaviors.  \nTape IV catheters around the entire circumference of the limb, including the hub and catheter adapter port to adequately \nsecure the catheter. The tape should be snug but use caution to prevent excessive tightness that will result in distal limb \nedema. Monitor the MWD regularly and loosen the catheter tape if swelling or edema is noted.  \nFor long -term management, an Elizabethan collar (e- collar) should be used. If the MWD quickly damages a standard e -collar, \nanother simple option is to make a preventive device. The bottom of a standard bucket is removed, 4 to 5 holes are drilled in \nthe bas e of the bucket, and cable ties are used through the holes to secure the bucket to the dog’s collar. The bucket -collar \ncombination is then applied. Figures 22 and 23 show the bucket technique and the appearance after application to the \nMWD.  \nFigure 22.
